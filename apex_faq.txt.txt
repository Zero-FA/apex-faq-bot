Trailing Drawdown and Rules
Understanding the Trailing Threshold and Evaluation Rules (Master Course)
Introduction

This guide covers how the trailing threshold works with trading evaluation and funded accounts, including specific details for RITHMIC and TRADOVATE accounts. We’ll explain trailing drawdowns, max drawdowns, and evaluation rules and provide tips for monitoring your account effectively.

The video below summarises the Trailing Drawdown Threshold:

Key Concepts
Starting Balance: Your account starts with an initial balance, and each plan has a specified maximum number of contracts you can trade.
No Daily Max Drawdown: There is no daily maximum drawdown limit.
Max Loss Drawdown: Each plan has a varying max loss drawdown. For example, a $50k plan starts at $47,500, which is $2,500 below the initial $50k balance.
Trailing Drawdown Example
To better understand how the trailing threshold works, let’s go through a practical example:

Starting Balance: $50,000
Allowed Drawdown: $2,500, meaning your threshold begins at $47,500.
First Trade: You make $500 and close the trade. Now, your balance is $50,500, and your threshold will update to $48,000 (the remaining $2,500 below your new balance).
Second Trade: During the next trade, your balance peaks at $50,800, but you only close the trade at $50,100. Your threshold will be $48,375, trailing $2,500 behind the highest balance reached ($50,875) even though you closed at a lower amount.


This example highlights that the trailing threshold is based on the highest live value during trades, not on closed trade values. It’s crucial to remember this to avoid unintentionally exceeding the maximum drawdown.

Drawdown Types: FULL vs. STATIC Accounts
FULL Accounts:
In paid/funded accounts, the max drawdown stops trailing once the liquidation threshold is the initial balance plus $100 (e.g., $50,100 on a 50k plan).
The trailing threshold stops moving once your unrealized balance exceeds the plan’s start balance by the drawdown amount plus $100.
The example below illustrates a trailing drawdown level at 25 points using 5 contracts on NQ, which would be around the $2500 trailing drawdown for the $50,000 account.

STATIC Accounts:
The drawdown level remains unchanged. For instance, a 100k static account has a set drawdown at $99,375.
The example below illustrates a fixed drawdown level at roughly 10.5 points using 3 contracts on NQ, which would be around the $625 static drawdown for the $100,000 account.

Trailing Max Drawdown by Plan and Contract Size
Plan Account Size Max Loss/Trailing Threshold

25K Full Size 4 Minis - 1500

50K Full Size 10 Minis - 2500

75K Full Size 12 Minis - 2750

100K Full Size 14 Minis - 3000

150K Full Size 17 Minis - 5000

250K Full Size 27 Minis - 6500

300K Full Size 35 Minis - 7500

100K Static 2 Minis - 625

Special Rules for RITHMIC and TRADOVATE Accounts For Trailing Drawdown
RITHMIC Accounts: During the evaluation, the drawdown stops trailing when the threshold balance reaches your profit target (not the account balance). For instance, a 50K account stops trailing when the threshold reaches $53,000.
TRADOVATE Accounts: The trailing drawdown continues to trail in evaluations and does not stop.
Monitoring Your Account and Avoiding Liquidation
Max Drawdown Monitoring: Always check your trailing max drawdown in your RTrader or Tradovate dashboard. The auto-liquidation threshold reflects this value.
Drawdown Failure: Dropping below the drawdown threshold fails the evaluation.
Rithmic and Tradovate Access: For RITHMIC accounts, download RTrader Pro from the member area. Both RTrader and Tradovate platforms allow you to monitor and control your account.
Evaluation Account Rules
Account Balance: Your balance must close at or above the profit goal without hitting the max drawdown. Ensure a clear understanding of the Trailing Threshold Drawdown to prevent accidental liquidation.
Minimum Trading Days: Complete a minimum of seven trading days (non-consecutive) for a valid evaluation (subject to any active promotions for 1-day-pass).
Professional Conduct: Follow the code of conduct and maintain professionalism. Sharing your username or password is prohibited.
Account Monitoring: Keep RTrader/Tradovate open to monitor your balance and max drawdown, and as a backup for closing trades if needed. Stay aware of the trailing threshold.
Trailing Threshold Awareness: Track the trailing threshold carefully, as it moves with the highest profit point achieved in active trades and can impact your evaluation outcome if not managed
Evaluation Account General Guidelines
Trade Close-Out Timing:
All trades must be closed, and all pending orders canceled by 4:59 PM ET. Holding trades through the close is not permitted.
APEX has a safeguard to automatically close open positions and cancel pending orders attached to a position at 4:59 PM ET. This safeguard is a final resort and should not be relied upon. Therefore, you must manually cancel orders not attached to a position. If they remain open, they may liquidate your account.
Markets requiring an earlier close are unaffected by this rule and must still be closed manually by the trader.
Holiday Trading:
Holidays and Half-Day Closures: You can trade on holidays if the market is open; however, half-day holidays do not count as trading days. This trading day is combined with the next trading day.
Important Note: During early holiday closures, trades must be closed at the market’s designated earlier time.
Automatic Close-Out Safeguard:
The 4:59 PM rule is a fail-safe, not a primary trade-close tool. It’s your responsibility to close all trades before 4:59 PM ET.
Leaving trades open may result in gaps that affect your threshold, potentially causing account failure. Relying solely on the auto-close feature is risky.
Maintaining the Profit Goal:
If you reach the profit goal before completing the minimum trading days, ensure your balance stays above the goal until the minimum trading requirement is met.
Account Status & Renewal:
Failed Account Reset: Accounts that fail and aren’t reset within eight days will be disabled if there are no active subscriptions. Reset the account or open a new one to continue.
Negative Balance on Renewal: A negative initial balance upon renewal doesn’t mean a failed evaluation; only a negative drawdown will constitute a failure. Accounts in a Failed or Blown state will receive a reset upon renewal.
Reminder: Please review the specific rules of Apex Trader Funding rather than assuming similarities with other companies. These evaluation guidelines are designed to help you meet the standards Apex sets for successful account funding.

Consistency and Planning for Success
Trading Consistency: Randomly changing trade sizes or going “all in” undermines long-term success. Following a consistent trading plan helps you grow your account steadily.
Consistency Rules: These apply mainly to PA and Funded accounts, where steady, structured trading is required.
Important: The trailing threshold provides a safety margin, but understanding its dynamics and monitoring it in real time is crucial to avoid unintended account liquidation.

Common Helpdesk Questions
These comprehensive answers are related to frequently asked questions, which will help you navigate our platform effectively. Please read carefully to fully understand our policies and procedures.

Platform Conversion
Can I convert from Rithmic to Tradovate or vice versa?

No, the account setups for Rithmic and Tradovate are different, and each platform has its own fees. If you wish to switch platforms, you must sign up for a new plan specific to that platform.

How important is it that I sign up for the right plan?

It is paramount that you choose the correct plan on our website or dashboard. If you select the wrong plan or platform, there will be no refunds, with no exceptions. We incur charges for every new account setup and cannot issue refunds for user mistakes. Please read all options carefully before you click to pay for your account! 

Evaluation Trading Accounts
Can I take the evaluation trading in SIM, or do I have to trade with live money?

All evaluations are conducted using simulation (SIM) accounts. You will log in with your Rithmic and/or Tradovate username and password, then select your evaluation account(s) for trading.

During the evaluation period, can I trade my evaluations, PAs, and my own account simultaneously?

Yes, if you have your own NinjaTrader license key, you can trade your evaluations, Performance Accounts (PAs), and your personal account at the same time.

Trading Frequency During Evaluation
Do I have to trade every day during my evaluation time?

No, you are not required to trade every day. You can take days off as needed. Trades can be spread out over time, as long as you have a minimum of seven traded days to qualify. There are no set time restrictions for eligibility.

Recurring Payments: Payments are made every 30 days for as long as you need the evaluation account.
Resets: You can reset the account as many times as necessary. Remember, you must have traded a minimum of seven days to qualify, regardless of how long it takes (unless there is an active promotion, including 1-day pass).
Maximum Position Size on Regular Contracts and Micros
What is the max position size on regular contracts and micros?

Max Position Size: The maximum position size is limited by the number of contracts specified in your chosen plan. This applies to all instruments and positions. For example, if your maximum is 10 contracts, you could trade 7 contracts on ES and 3 contracts on GC simultaneously, totaling 10 contracts. Orders exceeding this limit will be rejected.

Micros: You can trade micro contracts up to the maximum contract size listed for your plan. Available micro futures include:

Micro Futures Symbol Exchange

Micro E-Mini S&P 500 MES CME

Micro E-Mini Dow Jones MYM CME

Micro E-Mini Nasdaq-100 MNQ CME

Micro E-Mini Russell 2000 M2K CME

E-Micro Gold MGC CME

E-Micro AUD/USD M6A CME

E-Micro EUR/USD M6E CME

E-Micro USD/JPY M6J CME

Micro Crude Oil MCL NYMEX

Starting Your Evaluation
How many profitable weeks should I have before I’m ready for an evaluation?
You can start now! There is no requirement to have a certain number of profitable weeks before beginning an evaluation. In fact, our program offers an economical way to learn to trade and risk management without risking your own capital.

Learning Opportunity: Use the evaluation to develop your trading skills and strategies.
Risk Management: Avoid risking personal funds needed for essential expenses like retirement or education.
Leverage: For a small monthly fee, you can leverage substantial capital with the potential to receive payouts.
Age Requirement
What is the age requirement for having an evaluation and a funded account?

You must be 18 years old or older to participate in our evaluations and funded accounts. Breaching this rule will result in a permanent ban on using Apex services in the future.

Trading Days and Holidays
Do Sundays and holidays count as trading days?

• Sundays: Trading on Sundays counts as part of Monday’s trading day. A trading day is defined as 6:00 PM ET one day until 4:59 PM ET the next day.

• Holidays: You can trade on holidays if the market is open. However, half-day holidays do not count as a trading day.

Account Types: Static vs. Full
What is the difference between Static and Full Accounts?

• Static Accounts: These accounts have a fixed trailing threshold that does not adjust with your account balance.

• Full Accounts: These accounts have a trailing threshold that adjusts with your account balance and allows for larger contract sizes and stop-loss limits.

Account Activation Timing
Can I sign up today and start 10 days later?

Yes, you can sign up today and begin trading at a later date. However, please note that your monthly billing cycle starts on the day you sign up.

Trading Style
Do I continue trading the way I am now, or do I have to trade another way?

You can continue trading in your current style. However, to comply with our end-of-day policies, you must ensure that all your trades are closed by 4:59 PM ET each day.

Evaluation Time Frame
Do I have to complete the evaluation in a certain number of days?

You need to log seven trading days as part of the criteria to pass the evaluation, but there is no maximum time limit. You can take as long as you need to qualify.

NinjaTrader License Key
Do I have to use my own NinjaTrader license key?

No, you don’t have to use your own key. We provide you with a NinjaTrader license key if needed.

Profit Target Trading Days (Outside of 1-day-pass promotions)

Seven trading days are the minimum required days for the profit target. What is the maximum?

There is no maximum. You can take as long as you need to qualify. To pass the evaluation, you must:

Trade at least seven separate trading days
Meet the profit goal
Follow all trading rules
Demonstrate consistent trading ability
Professional Status and Data Fees
What is the difference between “non-professional” and “professional”?

Non-Professional: Most traders are non-professional, and your data fees are included in your plan.

Professional: Selecting ‘Professional’ incurs extra fees. For CME professional data, fees are $115 or more per calendar month per exchange, in addition to other fees. Only select ‘Professional’ when setting up Rithmic if you are truly a professional trader.


Important: Choosing ‘Professional’ unnecessarily will result in significant additional costs.

Margin Calls
Who gets the margin call if it happens?

You do not receive margin calls. Apex Trader Funding handles all margin requirements internally.

Profit Goals and Commissions
Is the profit goal net of commissions after all in costs (profits and losses)?

Yes, the profit goal is net of commissions and all associated costs. You can view your real-time profit and loss (PnL) and account balances in RTrader or the Tradovate web app.

Account Violations and Resets
What happens if I violate a trading rule?

If you receive an error message indicating a rule violation (e.g., surpassing the maximum drawdown), your account may be disabled.

Evaluation Accounts: You will need to reset your account or start a new evaluation. Resets allow you to start over with the full balance and trailing threshold.
Performance Accounts (PAs): Resets are not available. Violations in a PA account may lead to account closure.
Trading Multiple Accounts
Why would I want to trade multiple evaluation accounts?

Trading multiple accounts can diversify your strategies and increase potential profits. For a detailed explanation, please refer to our video here:

Data Fees Responsibility
Am I responsible for data fees?

Level 1 Data: Level 1 data (L1) is included in your fee; there are no additional charges.
Depth of Market (DOM):
Rithmic: If you purchase DOM through Rithmic, it will expire on the last day of the month and will not auto-renew. You must manually purchase it again if needed, regardless of the purchase date.
Tradovate: If you purchase additional data feeds through Tradovate, you will need to cancel those feeds directly through Tradovate if you no longer wish to be billed.
Eval Charts Tutorial and Troubleshooting
Our Evaluation and PA Charts provide a clear visual overview of your trading performance and account status. On the left-hand side, the ‘Eval Charts’ or ‘PA Charts’ section in the sidebar is where you access these detailed graphs and tables. 

At the top, you’ll see a cumulative Profit and Loss (PnL) chart, which shows how your account’s profits or losses have changed over time, measured in trading days.
Directly underneath, each row of the table displays key account metrics updated nightly at midnight ET. These include your most recent trade date, account type, total PnL, and the number of trading days completed. You can also see critical thresholds such as the trailing stop (maximum allowed drawdown), current account balance, target profit levels, and an easy-to-read progress bar that visually indicates how close you are to reaching the goals or potential breaches. 

Finally, the status and state columns inform you if the account is active, inactive, passed, or blown, ensuring you always know exactly where you stand in your evaluation or PA journey.

30 Day Subscriptions
This article provides detailed information about the fees associated with your Evaluation Account, what happens if you fail the evaluation, and how to manage your account/subscription effectively.

Are There Any Other Fees Besides the Monthly Fees?
No, there are no additional fees besides the monthly Evaluation fee.

The monthly Evaluation fee includes everything you need to trade:

Evaluation Account with all tracking features
Level 1 Data feed access
NinjaTrader Platform License key
Optional Fee:

Reset Fee: If you fail the evaluation test, you can reset your account for an additional fee. This does not change your 30-day billing cycle; it is simply a fee that resets your balance alone.
Transition to a Performance Account (PA):
When you pass the evaluation, the fees for your Evaluation Account continue until you pay the PA activation fee to convert your evaluation into a performance account.
If you choose to continue with a Performance Account, the fees for the PA account will begin and your evaluation subscription is automatically canceled upon conversion to PA.
Does Failing an Evaluation Cancel My Account Automatically?
No, failing an evaluation does not automatically cancel your account.

Options After Failing:

Reset Your Account: You can opt to reset your Evaluation Account to start the evaluation process again with the original billing cycle.
Cancel Your Account: To cancel, you must log in to your Members’ Area and manually cancel your subscription.
Renewing Subscription: If your account is in a failed status as of the market close on the day before the renewal, we will reset the balance as part of the renewal fee.
Important:

Recurring Billing: If you do not cancel your account, billing will continue to recur every 30 days.
Resets
If you’ve reached the drawdown threshold (max loss) in your Evaluation account and can no longer trade—receiving an error message stating, “Trades Can only Be Placed By Administrator”—you may need to reset your account. This guide explains how to reset your evaluation account and the associated policies, and it provides step-by-step instructions.

Why Reset Your Account?
Resetting allows you to:

Start Fresh: Begin with a full balance and full trailing drawdown.
Zero Days Traded: Reset your accumulated trading days.
Continue Trading: Resume trading within your current subscription period without interruption.
How to Reset Your Account
Step-by-Step Instructions

Close All Positions (Important: Ensure all positions are closed before initiating a reset.)
Log In to the Members’ Area
Visit https://apextraderfunding.com/member.
Enter your credentials to access your account.
Purchase a Reset
Navigate to the account you wish to reset.
Click on the “Reset” button next to that account.
Costs (Unless there is an active promotion):
Rithmic Accounts: $80 per reset.
Tradovate Accounts: $100 per reset.
Confirm the Reset
Double-check: Make sure you’ve selected the correct account. This action is irreversible.
Proceed with the payment to complete the reset process.
Wait for Processing
Resets typically finish within 10 minutes, but may sometimes take longer.
 


Important Notes
Renewal Date Unchanged: Resets do not alter your account’s renewal or expiration date.
Irreversible Action: Once initiated, a reset cannot be undone.
Canceled Invoices: Resetting will not reinstate a previously canceled invoice.
Our Policy on Resets During Your Monthly Renewal

If your Evaluation account is in a failed status and you forget to cancel before the renewal date:

Automatic Charge: The subscription fee will be charged after midnight on the renewal date.
Automatic Reset: Your account will be reset automatically at no additional reset fee.
Trading Resumption: You can resume trading as your account will be active again.
Conditions for Free Reset on Renewal
Failed Status Required: The account must be in a failed status by the market close before renewal.
Subscription Renewal: The monthly fee must be charged; a free reset applies only upon renewal.
Automatic Process: The reset happens automatically after the fee is charged.
Manual Options:
Immediate Reset: You can manually reset before renewal by paying the reset fee.
New Account: Alternatively, cancel the current account and sign up for a new one to expedite funding.
Refund Policy
No Refunds on Resets: All reset fees are non-refundable.
Not Retroactive: The policy doesn’t apply to past resets.
Evaluation Accounts Only: This policy is exclusive to Evaluation accounts.
Single Reset per Renewal: If you fail the account after a reset, we won’t reset it for free again unless it renews in a failed status.


Additional Options and Tips
Unlimited Resets: You can reset your account as many times as needed without penalties.
Impact of Reset: Only your drawdown, initial balance, and trading days are affected; the renewal date stays the same.
Faster Funding: To avoid delays, consider resetting manually or signing up for a new account.
Purpose of This Policy

This policy assists traders who might forget they can cancel and sign up again using available discount promotions, preventing unnecessary charges for both renewal and reset fees.

Reminder

Close Positions Before Resetting: Always ensure all trades are closed.
Select the Correct Account: Verify you’re resetting the right account to avoid irreversible errors.
Processing Time: While usually quick, resets can sometimes take longer than 10 minutes. Please wait for the account to be created or submit a ticket for missing accounts. Resetting the same account twice cannot be reversed, and you will pay twice for a single reset balance.
Failed Renewals
At Apex, we strive to ensure a seamless experience for all our users. To support you in maintaining uninterrupted access to our services, we offer a 72-hour grace period for any failed renewal payments. This generous timeframe provides ample opportunity to update your payment details or manually renew your account, ensuring that your services continue without disruption.

What Happens During the 72-Hour Grace Period?
If a renewal payment does not go through, you will have three days to address the issue. During this period, you can:

Update Your Payment Information: Easily change your credit card details to ensure future payments are processed smoothly.
Manually Renew Your Account: Take control of your renewal process to avoid any service interruptions.
How to Manually Renew Your Account
To assist you in managing your account effectively, we have created a step-by-step guide below. Additionally, you can watch the accompanying video that demonstrates these steps visually.

Navigate to Your Apex Dashboard
Log in to your account and access the Apex Dashboard, your central hub for managing all account settings and information.
Click on Payment History
On the right-hand side of the dashboard, locate and click the Payment History tab. This section provides a detailed overview of all your past transactions and any failed payments.
Find the Invoice to Manually Renew
Browse through your payment history to identify the specific invoice that requires manual renewal. This is typically marked or flagged for your attention.
Click the Renew Manually Link
Once you've located the relevant invoice, click on the Renew Manually link. This action will prompt you to enter new payment details or confirm your existing information to complete the renewal process.

Important Note on Credit Card Information
When you manually renew your account using a different credit card, especially for accounts on CIM_2 (secure credit card processor 3), the new card information will become the default for all future renewals on that platform. To ensure accuracy and avoid any unintended charges, please remember to update your credit card information after performing a manual renewal if necessary.

Evaluation Passed, Converting to a PA, PA Fees, and How to Activate

Account Status
Congratulations on reaching the funding stage! This guide will walk you through the process of transitioning from an Evaluation Account to a Simulated Funded (PA) Account seamlessly and efficiently.

No Initial Requirements
There are no credit checks, background checks, or asset requirements to obtain an Evaluation Account or a PA Account. The only prerequisite is passing the evaluation test, which demonstrates your trading proficiency.

Transitioning to a Simulated Funded Account
When you’re ready to move from an Evaluation Account to a Simulated Funded (PA) Account, the following steps will apply:

Standard Paperwork: You will complete the same paperwork required to open a regular broker account.
Background Checks: Standard background verification procedures will be conducted.
Identity Verification: We reserve the right to verify your identity at any time to ensure account security.
After Passing the Evaluation
Evaluation Passed, Profit Target Hit, and Seven Trading Days Completed—What’s Next?

Once you have successfully passed your evaluation by meeting the profit target and completing seven trading days, here’s what you need to do:

Do Nothing: After passing the evaluation, do not cancel or reset your passed Evaluation Account. Let the process proceed automatically.
Monitor Your Email: Within two business days after the seventh trading day, you will receive an email containing:
A contract link
A payment link for your PA Account
This information will also be on the signatures tab of your Member’s Area. Note: This tab only shows up after you pass your first evaluation.


Verify Your Status:
Go to your Eval Charts tab.
Ensure you have completed seven trading days and met the account balance requirements. Your passed evaluation will also show up on your signatures tab, as shown above.
Note that updates may only appear on the eighth day.
Stop Trading on Evaluation Account: Cease all trading activities on your Evaluation Account to maintain your “Passed” status. If your account balance falls below the profit target after seven days, the status will change to “Not Passed.”
Keep your subscription active. Only evaluations still on an active billing cycle can be converted to a PA. If you pass one day before your rebilling date and fully activate your PA account within 48 hours from the moment your evaluation account passes, we can refund the evaluation renewal fee. To request a refund, please send a help desk ticket.
(Please note: An evaluation must be passed prior to market close the day before the renewal billing date.)

Automated Process
The transition to a PA Account is automated. Once the system detects that you have completed seven days of trading and met the profit target, it initiates the process on the eighth day.

No Need for Help Desk Tickets: Submitting a help desk ticket is unnecessary and will not expedite the process. The Help Desk does not have additional information regarding automated transitions.
Delayed Emails: If you do not receive the contract or payment link emails by the tenth day, then you may submit a help desk ticket for assistance. Before submitting a ticket, please check your signatures tab on your Member’s Area for the passed evaluation contract/payment links.
Finalizing Your PA Account
Sign the Contract and Make Payment:
Use the links provided in the email or on your Member’s Area Dashboard to sign the contract and complete the payment for your PA Account.
Once you sign the contract, you cannot re-access it. It is your responsibility to download the contract before you submit your signature. These documents are system-generated, and we cannot send out a blank copy. You will be required to pass another evaluation to download the contract.
Once you pay, the system will automatically cancel your passed Evaluation Account. Do not manually cancel the Evaluation Account yourself.
Activation of PA Account:
After completing the payment, you will receive an email notification confirming that your PA Account is ready for trading. Note: This process can take up to 4 hours for accounts to be created. Please do not submit a ticket until after this period.
Log In: Use the same username and password as your Evaluation Account.
Seamless Transition: Your PA Account will function just like your Evaluation Account, with no need to adjust to any new systems or procedures.
Signatures Tab
Activating your PA accounts correctly is essential for smooth operations and avoiding errors. Here, we outline the recommended steps for sequential activation, explain the system's processing order, and provide clarity on payment options for Lifetime and Monthly fees. Follow the instructions carefully to ensure accurate fee assignments and avoid irreversible setup issues. Visual guides (GIFs) are included to help you through the payment process for both Lifetime and Monthly options.

PA Account Assignment and Activation Order
To ensure correct fee assignments, it is recommended to activate your evaluations in numerical order:

Activate Passed Evaluation Accounts Sequentially: Start with Evaluation 01, followed by 02, and so forth.
Prioritize Lifetime Fees Over Monthly Fees: Pay for Lifetime PA fees first before addressing Monthly PA payments.
System Processing Order:

Payments are processed from the lowest to the highest account number.
Once a payment is set up, it cannot be altered because fees are charged immediately.
Example: If you have accounts 01, 02, 03, and 04, and you attempt to pay for and activate accounts 03 and 04 simultaneously, the system will prioritize activating accounts 01 and 02 first because of their lower account numbers. This prioritization applies to both Monthly and Lifetime PA Fees.

Activation Limit: You can activate and pay for up to 20 PA accounts. Once these accounts are set up, changes or cancellations are not possible.

Payment Deadlines and Refund Policy
After passing your Evaluation Account, you must sign your PA agreements and promptly pay your PA fee using the Signatures tab or your Apex Dashboard.

Refunds:

If you pass your Evaluation Account before 5 PM ET on the day before your rebilling date and fully activate your PA account within 48 hours, you are eligible for a refund of the evaluation renewal fee (NOT the original account fee). Submit a Help Desk ticket with your account number (e.g., APEX-12345-67) to request this refund.
Important: Evaluations must be passed before market close on the day preceding the renewal billing date.
If you pass on the same day as your rebilling date, refunds for rebilling charges are not available. Remember, if your renewal date is the 20th, any trades after 6 PM ET on the 19th are classified as the trading day for the 20th, and this will count as the first day of your new subscription cycle.
If the Evaluation Account passed more than 1 day before your rebilling date, you will not be eligible for refunds of the renewal fee if you have not converted to a PA before the fee is charged.
Late Payments:

If you exceed the 48-hour window to set up your PA account after passing your Evaluation Account, no refunds will be processed for any recurring charges incurred during this period.
It is your responsibility to complete the PA setup within the 48-hour timeframe. Failure to do so means your passed Evaluation Accounts must remain active by paying the monthly renewal fees until you can finalize the PA setup and sign the necessary agreements.
No Exceptions: Recurring charges are non-refundable under any circumstances.
Understanding PA Account Fees and Payment Options
At Apex, managing your Paid Performance (PA) accounts is streamlined, with clear fee structures and payment options designed to suit your trading needs. Whether you're a new trader or managing multiple accounts, it's essential to understand the lifetime and monthly fee options, activation procedures, and billing processes to make informed decisions. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of PA account fees, payment options, and essential procedures to ensure a smooth experience with Apex.

Lifetime and Monthly Fee Options
Apex offers options for PA accounts to be paid via a Lifetime Fee or a monthly subscription. Once you have completed the payment for one of these options, the decision cannot be changed. Refunds will not be issued to change your payment decision.

Key Points:

Immutable Payment Choice: Once a payment option (Monthly or Lifetime) is selected for an individual PA account, it cannot be altered. For instance, if you choose the Monthly option during account setup, upgrading to a Lifetime Fee later is not permitted.
No Exceptions: Apex strictly enforces this policy. Attempts to request changes or exceptions through the Help Desk will not be accommodated.
PA Account Activation and Payment Process
After successfully passing your Evaluation Account, you will receive emails with instructions on signing your Contract Documents for the PA Account and a link to complete the payment. Alternatively, you can access these documents through your Apextraderfunding.com Dashboard under the Signatures tab. Once the Pending signatures are completed, the payment link becomes available automatically.

Rithmic PA Account Fees
When setting up a Rithmic PA account, you have the option to choose between a Monthly Fee of $85 or a Lifetime Payment Fee. Below are the Lifetime Fee structures based on the activation account size:

25k PA Activation Account: $130 (Lifetime)
50k PA Activation Account: $140 (Lifetime)
75k PA Activation Account: $180 (Lifetime)
100k PA Activation Account (Full and Static): $220 (Lifetime)
150k PA Activation Account: $260 (Lifetime)
250k PA Activation Account: $300 (Lifetime)
300k PA Activation Account: $340 (Lifetime)
Important: Once you select either the Monthly or Lifetime option during the checkout process, this decision is final for that specific account. Monthly payments cannot be changed to Lifetime.

Tradovate PA Account Fees
For Tradovate PA accounts, the payment options include a Monthly Fee of $105 or a Lifetime Payment Fee. The Lifetime Fees for Tradovate PA accounts are as follows:

25k PA Tradovate Activation Account: $150 (Lifetime)
50k PA Tradovate Activation Account: $160 (Lifetime)
75k PA Tradovate Activation Account: $200 (Lifetime)
100k PA Tradovate Activation Account: $240 (Lifetime)
150k PA Tradovate Activation Account: $280 (Lifetime)
250k PA Tradovate Activation Account: $320 (Lifetime)
300k PA Tradovate Activation Account: $360 (Lifetime)
Note: Similar to Rithmic PA accounts, you cannot change the payment option for a Tradovate PA account after selecting one.

Billing for Paid/Funded Accounts
Each paid or funded PA account is billed individually. For example, if you manage three paid/funded accounts, you will receive three separate bills corresponding to each account. This ensures clarity and precise tracking of your payments.

Need Assistance?
If you encounter any issues or do not receive the necessary emails within the specified timeframe, please submit a help desk ticket for further assistance. Remember, submitting a ticket before day ten will not expedite the automated process.

What are the Consistency Rules for PA and Live Accounts?
At Apex Trader Funding, we believe responsible, disciplined trading is the key to long-term success. Our consistency rules for PA and Live accounts are designed to help you build a sustainable and successful trading career. These rules are not just about limitations; they are about creating a strong foundation for you to grow and thrive as a trader.

Building Steady, Compounding Growth

Apex Trader Funding is here to support traders who are committed to steady, consistent growth. Unlike Evaluation Accounts, which focus on assessing your ability to meet short-term profit goals, PA and Live accounts encourage you to grow your account in a way that is sustainable and compounding. By following a consistent approach, you can experience growth that builds over time, creating a foundation for long-term success.

Our goal is to fund traders who trade with discipline and patience, not those seeking quick, speculative wins. When you approach trading with consistency, you’re creating a strategy that works for the long run—making you a more confident, responsible trader.

Risk Management: The Key to Long-Term Success

At Apex, risk management is a crucial part of your journey. Our consistency rules are in place to help you manage risk effectively and avoid taking unnecessary risks. We want to help you trade with confidence, knowing that your strategies align with your long-term goals.

By maintaining a steady approach to trade size, stop losses, and profit targets, you’ll be able to build a balanced trading plan. For example, using consistent contract sizes and avoiding erratic changes in trade size helps create a predictable, steady growth trajectory. This kind of disciplined trading ensures that you can stay in control, even in volatile markets.

Focus on Strategy, Not Speculation

Apex values traders who take a strategic approach to their trades. We encourage thoughtful, deliberate decision-making and discourage erratic trading behaviors that can lead to unpredictable results. We want to see traders who understand market conditions, adjust their strategy accordingly, and trade with purpose.

By avoiding high-frequency trading or flipping contracts just to “meet a daily minimum,” you’re demonstrating that you’re in it for the long term—not just short-term gains. Apex’s consistency rules are designed to keep you on track, helping you build your skills, manage your risk, and grow your account in a way that reflects your ability to trade professionally.

A Long-Term Relationship with Apex

When you trade with Apex, we see it as a partnership. We want to fund consistent, reliable traders who are committed to growing their accounts over time. Apex is more than just a funding provider—we’re here to support your journey and help you develop a strategy that works for you.

We value traders who treat trading as a profession, not a gamble. By adhering to our consistency rules, you’re showing that you’re ready for a long-term relationship—one where you can grow your account and increase your profitability in a sustainable way.

PA and Live Funded Accounts
At Apex Trader Funding, we believe that responsible, disciplined trading is the key to long-term success. Our consistency rules for PA and Live accounts are designed to help you build a sustainable and successful trading career. These rules are not just about limitations; they are about creating a strong foundation for you to grow and thrive as a trader.

Violating these rules can result in denied payouts and even account closure, so it's essential to understand and follow them carefully. Let’s break down what Apex expects from its traders and how you can maintain compliance.

Evaluation Accounts
Evaluation Accounts do not have the same consistency rules as PA or Live Accounts. The primary goal of the Evaluation Account is to assess your ability to meet profit targets and evaluate your performance in a simulated (demo) environment. During this phase, traders focus on overcoming the Trailing Drawdown, which is a key feature to understand. The Trailing Drawdown rule helps you manage risk and adjust your trading behavior as you work through unpredictable market conditions.

The market can be volatile during the evaluation phase, and your strategy needs to be flexible enough to adapt to changing conditions. This period allows you to focus on risk management, especially by understanding how the Trailing Drawdown works. Adjusting your strategy to maintain control over your risk is essential during this phase.

Once you successfully pass the evaluation, you move to a PA or Live Account, where consistency rules are in place to promote steady and responsible growth. These accounts are designed for traders who demonstrate discipline and consistency in their trading strategies. Understanding these rules—what Apex wants and doesn’t want—is crucial.

Evaluation Accounts vs. PA/Live Accounts
Evaluation Accounts: There are no consistency rules during this phase, which is focused on meeting profit goals and overcoming the Trailing Drawdown.
PA and Live Accounts: Have specific consistency rules. Violating these rules could result in denied payouts or account closure.
By successfully navigating the evaluation phase, you set yourself up for the next stage, where you can move towards a funded account with a more structured trading approach.

Are Performance Accounts (PA) Live?
Performance Accounts (PAs) begin as simulated (SIM) accounts, but they use live market data to replicate real trading conditions. While these accounts are initially simulated, traders are paid just as they would be with a live account.

Starting with a SIM account offers advantages for both traders and the company. Trading can be unpredictable, and many traders may struggle to maintain their accounts in the early stages. Using SIM accounts initially provides a safety net, reducing the risk for both parties while still ensuring a realistic trading experience.

Transitioning to Live Accounts
When a trader demonstrates consistent performance in their SIM account, the trades are mirrored in a live account through an Application Programming Interface (API). This allows traders to continue refining their strategies while their success is evaluated in real-time market conditions.

Once long-term consistency is confirmed, the trader will be contacted regarding a transition to a live account. At this stage, the trader is directly engaging with live markets, and their account is no longer simulated. This process is directly communicated to the traders considered for Live Accounts. The Help Desk has no further information regarding hypothetical questions about Live Accounts. You will be contacted when considered. Do not submit tickets regarding this.

Key Terms:

SIM (Simulated): A practice account that replicates live market data but does not involve actual money or live trades.
API (Application Programming Interface): A tool that connects systems, enabling trades from a SIM account to be mirrored in a live account.
By taking this step-by-step approach, Performance Accounts (PAs) strike a balance between providing traders an opportunity to prove themselves and ensuring responsible risk management.

Trailing Drawdown Rule
In a Performance Account, the trailing drawdown starts at the liquidation threshold, which is determined by your plan's max drawdown amount. As your account balance increases, the trailing drawdown follows your peak unrealized balance until it reaches a fixed point, which is called the Safety Net (initial balance + drawdown limit + $100). The trailing drawdown stops moving when your peak unrealized account balance reaches the Safety Net. For a reminder on how the Trailing Drawdown Threshold works, click here.

Example; 

A $50,000 account has a safety net of $52,600, which is the $2500 drawdown plus $100.

A $150,000 account has a safety net of $155,100, which is the $5000 drawdown plus $100.

If you have $6000 profit for both accounts, the drawdown threshold will still be fixed at the starting balance plus $100.



Contract Scaling Rule
To promote disciplined growth, the Contract Scaling rule outlines how traders manage contract sizes during the growth phase of the account.

Initial Limit: Traders are restricted to trading half of their maximum allowed contracts until they reach the trailing threshold stop.
Threshold Reached: Once the account's End-of-Day (EOD) balance exceeds the trailing threshold (the initial balance + trailing drawdown + $100), traders can then use their full contract limit starting with the next full trading session.
For example, on a $50,000 Performance Account (PA) with a maximum of 10 contracts, traders can initially trade up to 5 contracts. When the account EOD balance reaches $52,600 ($50,000 initial balance + $2,500 trailing drawdown + $100 buffer), the trailing stop no longer applies, and traders can trade the full 10 contracts.

Once the trailing threshold is reached, traders can continue using the full contract limit even if the account balance drops below the threshold.

Single Violation Penalty: If more than half of the maximum allowed contracts are accidentally traded, traders are expected to close out the excessive contracts immediately. Failure to do so may result in the payout request being denied and the account being reset to the EOD balance from the previous trading day, which is the day before the first scaling rule violation occurred. The trader would then need to complete 8 additional compliant trading days before becoming eligible to request another payout.

Consistent Violation Penalty: Blatant or repeated violations of the scaling rule will result in account closure and forfeiture of all balances.

30% Negative PnL Rule
The 30% Negative Profit and Loss (PnL) Rule limits the loss a trader can incur on any single trade, providing a structured approach to risk management. Under this rule, the live, unrealized, open negative PnL cannot exceed 30% of the account's profit balance at the start of the day on a per-trade basis.

This is not a daily loss limit, but a control to prevent excessive loss on any individual trade. At any point, your open negative PnL should not surpass 30% of your start-of-day profit. Regularly monitor your trades and exposure to stay compliant with the rules.

30% Drawdown Limit: Your open trades should not exceed a 30% drawdown limit from your account’s profit balance. This helps protect your trading capital and encourages consistent trading practices. For new accounts or accounts with profits less than the equivalent initial trailing drawdown amount, the 30% rule is based on the trailing threshold (e.g., 30% of $2,500 on a $50,000 account is $750).
Example: For a $50,000 account, if your profit balance is $4,000, your drawdown limit would be 30% of $4,000, which is $1,200. This means your open trades should not incur losses greater than $1,200.
Adjustable Limits: As your account balance grows, you may qualify for a more flexible 50% drawdown limit. To qualify, your account needs to double the safety net (trailing drawdown + $100). This adjustment gives you extra room to trade once your account develops.
Example: If your account profit grows from $4,000 to $8,000, your drawdown limit can adjust to 50% of $8,000, allowing for a drawdown of $4,000 instead of $1,200.


At Apex Trader Funding, responsible trading is at the core of our practices, and managing drawdowns is a crucial part of that. Here’s what you need to know:

Continuous Monitoring: We encourage you to regularly monitor your trades and adjust your positions as needed to stay within these limits. If your drawdown approaches 30%, consider closing or adjusting your trades to avoid breaching the limit. Quick adjustments can help prevent any compliance issues.
Temporary Exceedances: If your drawdown momentarily exceeds 30% but you act quickly to manage the situation, there won’t be an automatic penalty. However, repeated or significant breaches could lead to warnings or account restrictions.
Adhering to these guidelines can ensure that your trading strategy remains robust and sustainable. These terms should be strictly followed to ensure consistent compliance with Apex's 30% negative PnL rule.

Static Accounts
The 30% Negative PnL rule for Static Accounts is designed to help manage risk by ensuring that losses are kept within safe limits. The rule applies in two stages: one when the account balance is below the safety net, and another when it exceeds the safety net.

Below the Safety Net ($2,600): When the account balance is below the $2,600 safety net, the maximum loss per trade is $187.50. This is 30% of the fixed $625 drawdown that applies to accounts at this stage. Essentially, until the balance surpasses the safety net, the rule restricts your loss on any single trade to $187.50.
Above the Safety Net ($2,600): Once the account balance exceeds $2,600, the 30% Negative PnL rule is recalculated based on the current profit balance in the account. For example, if your account reaches $103,000, which includes a $3,000 profit, the maximum allowable loss per trade is $900 (30% of the $3,000 profit).
30% Consistency Rule
The 30% Consistency Rule ensures that no single trading day accounts for more than 30% of the total profit balance at the time of a payout request. This rule promotes consistent trading practices and discourages high-risk, erratic trading styles.

Key Details to Note:

Profit Restrictions: If a single trading day generates more than 30% of the profit balance accumulated since the last approved payout—or since the start of trading if no payouts have been made—there may be restrictions on profit withdrawals.
Reset After Payout: Once a payout is approved, the 30% rule resets and applies only to profits earned after the most recent payout. It does not look back at previous trading periods.
Exceptions: The rule applies until the sixth payout or until the account is transferred to a Live Prop Trading Account. At that point, the 30% rule is no longer in effect.
This guideline is designed to ensure disciplined, consistent trading and is not meant to penalize traders who maintain a structured trading approach. However, it discourages traders who use a high-risk, windfall trading strategy to secure withdrawals without maintaining consistent trading behavior.

The 30% rule is reviewed during payout approvals, and payouts may be denied if the profit balance does not align with the rule’s parameters. Traders are encouraged to trade consistently and adhere to these guidelines to avoid issues with payout approvals.

Risk Management, Stop Losses, Profit Targets, Trailing
Apex Trader Funding provides traders with an opportunity to demonstrate disciplined risk management and effective trading strategies. Proper risk management is not just encouraged but is mandatory for all accounts, ensuring that trading is conducted responsibly and without speculative or reckless behavior.

5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio Rule
The 5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio Rule is a risk management guideline that ensures your trades are balanced with a responsible amount of risk relative to the potential profit. For every trade you make, your stop loss should not exceed five times the amount of your profit target.

For example:

If your profit target is 10 ticks, your maximum stop loss should be 50 ticks (5 times your profit target).
If you set a stop loss beyond 50 ticks, such as 100 ticks, this would violate the rule.
Following the 5:1 rule helps you manage risk by ensuring that you are not taking excessive losses relative to your target profits. This helps protect your account balance and encourages more disciplined trading over time. It also promotes a strategy where your potential rewards are always greater than the risks you are taking on each trade. By following the 5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio, you maintain a disciplined trading approach that supports long-term success and helps you manage risk effectively.

Stop Losses and Risk Management
Stop Losses Are Required: Trading without a stop loss or relying solely on the Trailing Threshold to manage risk is strictly prohibited. Every trade must have a pre-defined risk level, either through manual stop-loss orders or a mental plan that adheres to your strategy. Letting an account "blow out" by hitting the Trailing Threshold is not acceptable.
Risk-to-Reward Ratios: Apex enforces a maximum risk-to-reward ratio of 5:1. For instance, if your profit target is 10 ticks, your stop loss should not exceed 50 ticks. Similarly, if your goal is to make $100 in profit, the stop loss should not risk more than $500. This ensures responsible trading and prevents excessive risk on trades.
Prohibited Practices: Strategies that involve “all-in” trades with maximum contract sizes, particularly at the start of a PA account, to quickly overcome the trailing drawdown are prohibited. These windfall or gambling approaches violate Apex’s standards and may result in forfeiture of accounts or payouts.
Proper Use of Stop Losses and Profit Targets 
Planned Exits for Both Losses and Profits: Before initiating any trade, traders must have a clear plan for managing both risk and profit targets. Stop losses, profit targets, and trailing stops should align with the strategy's historical performance and back-tested data.
Trailing Stops for Profit Protection: As the market moves in your favor, trailing stops should be used to secure gains while allowing profits to run during trends. However, stops should not be moved backward to increase risk and potentially violate the drawdown rules. Adjusting stops forward to protect profits is a key aspect of effective risk management.
ATM Strategies for Automation: Apex encourages the use of ATM (Advanced Trade Management) strategies, which automate stop-loss and profit-target levels. These can be adjusted during trades to protect profits while adapting to market conditions.
Mental Stops Are Permitted: Traders familiar with their strategy may use mental stops instead of placing hard stop-loss orders. However, mental stops must still be honored. For traders on Probation, hard stop-loss levels are mandatory.


Trending and Long-Term Strategies

In trending or longer-term strategies where specific profit targets may not be clear, the initial stop loss becomes especially important. It defines the maximum risk, allowing the trade to be managed responsibly, even in volatile conditions.

Payout Evaluation Requirements

During the eight-day evaluation period, traders must demonstrate consistency by achieving a profit of at least $50 on five different trading days. Strategies such as "flipping" trades—closing and re-entering positions to adjust to market conditions—are allowed as long as they align with a structured plan and meet the $50 minimum profit requirement on eligible days.

Consistency and Discipline

Apex requires traders to demonstrate consistent and disciplined trading. Risk management strategies should avoid speculative windfall approaches, such as:

Entering large contract positions at the start of a PA account in an attempt to quickly overcome the trailing drawdown.
Using the Trailing Threshold limit to manage risk without applying proper stop-loss strategies.
Traders are expected to maintain consistent trade management practices, adhering to their system's guidelines for stop losses, profit targets, and risk-to-reward ratios.

Risk management is the cornerstone of successful trading. Every trade must include a defined risk level, a clear exit strategy for both profit and loss, and adherence to the 5:1 maximum risk-to-reward ratio. Reckless trading practices—such as speculative “all-in” trades, adjusting stops to increase risk, or relying solely on the Trailing Threshold to manage risk—are prohibited. By implementing a systematic and disciplined approach, traders can achieve consistent results while protecting their accounts and advancing toward Live Prop Trading Accounts.

Max Contracts Rule
The Max Contracts Rule ensures traders adhere to the defined contract limits for their account and discourages any attempts to abuse or circumvent these limits.

Key Guidelines:

Traders must not exceed the maximum contract limit set for their account at any time.
Attempts to bypass the limit through combined instruments or micro contracts are prohibited.
Examples of Violations:

Trading the maximum contracts on multiple instruments simultaneously (e.g., 10 contracts on ES and 10 on YM for a 10-contract limit account).
Exceeding the maximum contract limit directly (e.g., trading 20 contracts on a 10-contract limit account).
Using micro contracts in a way that circumvents the maximum contract rule (e.g., excessively trading micro contracts to replicate full contract exposure).
Repeated violations or attempts to abuse the max contracts rule will result in the termination of the account without a refund or payout. Traders are expected to respect these limits to maintain account compliance and avoid penalties.

By adhering to the Max Contracts Rule, traders can ensure they remain in good standing while fostering disciplined trading practices.

Contract Size Consistency Rule
Maintaining a consistent approach to contract sizes is essential for demonstrating disciplined and professional trading behavior. While the rules allow flexibility for strategic adjustments, erratic or manipulative changes in contract sizes are strictly prohibited.

Key Guidelines:

Consistent Strategy: Traders must use contract sizes that reflect a consistent trading approach. Adjustments based on market conditions, such as reducing size during high volatility or increasing size as the account balance grows, are acceptable as long as they align with a systematic strategy.
Example: Starting with 2 contracts and scaling up as profits increase is consistent. Conversely, trading 10 contracts one day and dropping to 2 contracts the next solely to secure a payout is not.
Scaling with Growth: As the account balance grows and the cushion increases, contract sizes should scale proportionally. This reflects disciplined account management and responsible risk-taking.
Example: A growing balance justifies a steady increase in contract sizes. Reducing contract sizes despite growth out of fear of losing profit before a withdrawal is considered a lack of discipline and an invalid strategy.
Responsible Adjustments for Losses: If the account balance decreases due to losses, it is reasonable and responsible to reduce contract sizes to manage risk. Similarly, after a withdrawal reduces the account balance, trading smaller sizes is prudent until growth resumes.
Prohibited Practices:

It is not allowed to use large contract sizes early in a PA Account to chase lucky trades or recover losses, followed by a sudden reduction in size.

Cycling through multiple PA Accounts by starting with substantial sizes, losing the balance, and resetting accounts to repeat this behavior is considered manipulative and is grounds for account termination.
Making drastic, inconsistent changes in contract size solely to manipulate payouts or the evaluation process will result in forfeiture of payouts and, potentially, probation status.
Expectations for Payout Eligibility:

Traders must maintain consistent trading behavior throughout the account's lifecycle, from inception to payout. This includes using the same contracts, sizes, and targets unless modifications are made logically due to account growth or loss.
To demonstrate profit stability, traders may be required to trade consistently for eight days with uniform contract sizes before becoming eligible for a payout request.
By adhering to these guidelines, traders can ensure their trading approach reflects professionalism and discipline. Apex is committed to funding responsible traders, not those engaging in high-risk, erratic, or manipulative practices. Consistency is key to maintaining account compliance and securing payouts.

Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) Rule
Dollar Cost Averaging (DCA) involves entering additional trades in the same direction as the original order, even if the market moves against the trader’s position. As the market moves contrary to the trade, the trader continues to add more entries in the same direction.

Key Guidelines:

Permitted Use: DCA is allowed under this agreement with no restrictions on contract size for additional entries.
No Entry Restrictions: There are no specific rules for determining entry points, timeframes, or distances from the original order.
Risk Management: Traders must maintain responsible risk-to-reward ratios when using DCA.
Compliance with Consistency Rules: DCA is acceptable as long as it does not violate other consistency rules, such as the 30% profit in a day rule or the 30% negative P&L rule.
Responsible Application: Traders are expected to apply DCA consistently and responsibly to adhere to these rules and avoid potential issues.
By following these guidelines, traders can effectively utilize DCA while adhering to the account’s rules and risk management framework.

Adding to Trades
Traders may add to their trades as the market moves in their favor, following a defined trading strategy or system rules. For example, if a trader enters a long position and the market moves positively, they may add additional long contracts to capitalize on the trend.

Key Guidelines:

Strategic Entries: Traders are permitted to scale into winning trades in PA Accounts, using larger contract sizes if supported by their strategy.
Directional Bias: All additions must align with a clear directional bias and follow a consistent, defined strategy. Random or reckless entries in hopes of a market turnaround are not allowed.
Acceptable Scaling: Adding contracts to a profitable trade as part of a structured approach is acceptable and encouraged for disciplined trading.
Prohibited Practices: Entering large contract sizes at the outset without a clear strategy or placing trades purely in anticipation of a market reversal is prohibited.
By adhering to these guidelines, traders can effectively scale into profitable trades while maintaining consistency and professionalism in their trading approach.

Safety Net Requirement Rule
The Safety Net Requirement rule ensures that your account maintains an adequate balance to protect against significant drawdowns. This rule applies to both new and existing accounts, but it’s only required for your first three payouts. After this, the safety net is no longer applicable.

How the Safety Net is Calculated:
The safety net is determined by adding $100 to your drawdown limit. This calculation ensures that there is a cushion in your account to absorb losses.

Example:

Account Size: $50,000
Drawdown Limit: $2,500
Safety Net: $2,500 + $100 = $2,600
Once the trader's balance exceeds $52,600 (which is the drawdown plus the safety net), they can request a payout. For more details on how the Safety Net Requirement Rule affects a payout request, please visit here.

Flipping Trades Rule
Flipping is Allowed at Apex Trader Funding, but it must be done strategically and within the guidelines. Flipping refers to opening and closing trades quickly within the same day. While this is allowed, it must meet certain criteria to count toward your trading goals. Here's what you need to know about the Flipping Trades Rule.

Conditions for Flipping:
Minimum Profit Requirement:
To count towards your trading day, you must achieve a minimum profit of $50 per day from the flipped trades. This ensures that flipping is done with a goal of steady profitability, rather than just making quick trades for the sake of meeting minimum activity.

Consistent Performance:
You must flip trades for at least 5 trading days to meet the eligibility criteria for consistent trading performance. This means that on each of those days, you need to hit the $50 profit target.

Example of Flipping Trades:
Day 1: A trader opens and closes several quick trades throughout the day, earning a $60 profit. Since this exceeds the $50 minimum, this day counts toward the 5-day trading goal.
Day 2 to Day 5: The same trader repeats the process over the next four days, earning a profit of at least $50 each day. This results in meeting the 5-day trading consistency requirement.
News Trading Rule
Apex Trader Funding allows traders to engage in news trading during significant market events, where rapid price movements can present profitable opportunities. However, to ensure responsible trading, the following guidelines must be followed:

One-Direction Rule
Single Position Rule: During news events, traders are only allowed to hold a position in one direction—either long (buy) or short (sell).
No Hedging: Holding both long and short positions simultaneously on the same instrument is strictly prohibited. This rule ensures that trades are based on strategic analysis rather than speculative attempts to hedge both sides during a news-driven breakout.
Consistency Rules Apply
30% Consistency Rule: Even during news trading, the 30% consistency rule still applies. Traders must not exceed the profit limit in a single trading day.
30% Negative P&L Rule: The 30% negative P&L rule must also be respected, meaning that open trades should not exceed 30% of your account’s profit balance as a loss.
Traders are expected to apply consistent strategies and responsible trading practices, whether trading during news events or in other market conditions. For example, if a trader takes a long position during a major news event, they must not open a short position on the same instrument during that period.



Violations and Consequences
Hedging Violations: Violating the one-direction rule by opening both long and short positions simultaneously will result in a review of your account and potential disciplinary actions. These actions may include account restrictions or even account closure.
Group or Partner Trading Schemes: Attempts to bypass the one-direction rule through group trading or partner schemes are strictly prohibited. Any involvement in such schemes will lead to the closure of all involved accounts, forfeiture of funds, and a permanent ban from the Apex Trader Funding platform.
By following the one-direction rule and all other consistency guidelines, traders can responsibly capitalize on opportunities during news events while adhering to Apex’s disciplined trading standards. Violating these rules could result in severe consequences, including account termination, to ensure all traders maintain a high standard of trading integrity and responsibility.

Automation in Trading
At Apex Trader Funding, the use of automation is strictly prohibited on PA and Live accounts. This includes any form of AI (Artificial Intelligence), Autobots, algorithms, fully automated trading systems, and high-frequency trading (HFTs). These types of systems that trade without active human intervention are not allowed.

Any type of hands-off, set-and-forget, or set-and-walk-away trading, including systems that run continuously 24 hours a day, is strictly prohibited. Using these types of automation will result in the immediate closure of your PA or Live account and the forfeiture of all funds and balances.

Semi-automated software can be used, but it must be actively monitored by the trader at all times. This means the trader must be present and actively managing the trades, making adjustments based on market conditions, news events, and other factors. The software should assist in executing trades based on predefined rules, but the trader must remain in control, overseeing every aspect of the trading process.

It’s also advised to turn off or pause the semi-automated software when market conditions aren’t ideal, or when a trade setup isn’t clear. The purpose of this software is to assist with the speed and accuracy of placing trades—not to act as a fully automated system that trades on its own.

By following these guidelines, you ensure that you remain in full control of your trades, using automation responsibly to enhance your trading process without replacing the trader's judgment.

Hedging and Correlated Instruments Rule
Traders shall not trade one direction on minis and another direction on micros at the same time. Traders shall not spread trade indices, i.e., long ES, and short YM. All Apex accounts must be traded directionally only and never be both long and short concurrently in the same account or in other accounts in any correlated markets. This includes all indices, metals, grains, or any correlating instrument, no matter the size, i.e., micro, mini, etc. For example, the trader cannot be short NQ and Long ES under any circumstance.



Copy or Trading Services Operations or Participation
Performance Accounts (PA) and Live Prop Accounts must be traded exclusively by the individual listed on the account. Under no circumstances can these accounts be managed or influenced by any other party, person, system, automated trading bot, copy trading service, or trade mirroring software.

Failure to comply with this rule constitutes an immediate breach of contract and will result in the closure of all associated accounts. Traders are required to maintain sole responsibility for all trading activity within their accounts to ensure compliance with Apex’s standards.

Defined System with Set Rules
At Apex Trader Funding, having a defined trading strategy with clear rules is essential for success. Traders are required to establish a system that includes set guidelines for entries, stops, targets, and trailing stops, and must follow these rules consistently and with discipline. This approach is designed to foster steady, sustainable trading, not speculative or erratic behavior.

What is a Defined System?

Traders must have a systematic approach to their trading that can be explained and tracked. The system should include:

Set Rules for every trade (entry points, stop losses, profit targets, and trailing stops).
A normal day-to-day system that can be consistently applied across multiple trading sessions.
Clear, trackable performance that can be explained if requested, ensuring transparency.
This systematic approach is critical for ensuring that the trader’s decisions are based on strategy, not emotion or random actions.

What Apex Doesn’t Want

Apex is not looking for traders who gamble with their accounts or aim for "lottery-style lucky windfalls." Traders who blow through multiple accounts in pursuit of big, unpredictable profits do not demonstrate the consistency and discipline Apex values. Think of it this way: If you were funding a trader, would you feel comfortable with someone who consistently takes reckless risks without a structured approach?

Review Process for Compliance

Apex reserves the right to request a detailed explanation of your trading system, including:

Marked-up charts of trades you’ve executed, as evidence of consistent rule adherence.
A live Zoom session to observe and confirm that you’re following your strategy during actual trading sessions.
Recordings of your trading sessions to review your system’s consistency, including explanations of your entries and exits.
Documentation showing the tools, indicators, platforms, and contract sizes used during your trading sessions.
Apex will use these materials to assess whether your trading strategy is consistent and aligned with the rules you’ve set. This process ensures that you’re adhering to a defined system and not relying on random or speculative actions.

Directional Bias and Consistency

Apex only approves directional trading strategies, where there is a clear bias for the trade. This means you should always have a predetermined direction and bias based on your system and not execute trades without this clarity. Traders are not allowed to place:

Bracket orders in both directions without a clear directional bias (e.g., long limit order and short limit order placed in anticipation of a breakout).
Trading strategies that involve chasing market movements or seeking windfall profits without a systematic approach.
This type of non-systematic trading, where trades are placed without a clear direction or rationale, is often a sign of a trader who does not have a defined strategy and is instead speculating on market moves. Apex does not tolerate this behavior.

Consequences of Non-Compliance

Any funds earned during periods of non-compliance or from trades that do not align with the approved system will be deducted from the account. This is in line with the PA Consistency guidelines outlined in the FAQ section and the video series on the Apex Trader Funding website.

Prohibited Activities
To maintain integrity and ensure funding is provided only to disciplined and consistent traders, Apex Trader Funding strictly prohibits the following activities in Performance Accounts (PA):

Trading Without Stop Losses or Risk Management: All trades must have either pending or mental stop losses and a well-defined risk management strategy. Trading without these measures is strictly prohibited.
High-Risk Strategies: Strategies that involve small profit targets while risking disproportionately large amounts are not allowed. For example, setting a five-tick profit target with a 150-tick stop loss demonstrates unacceptable risk management.
Using the Trailing Threshold as a Stop Loss: Traders are prohibited from using the account's full threshold as a stop-loss mechanism to absorb large losses, leading to account liquidation.
Stockpiling Evaluation Accounts: Purchasing multiple discounted evaluation accounts to cycle through and intentionally "blow up" accounts in pursuit of windfall profits is not permitted.
Unsustainable Strategies: Any trading, risk management, or implementation that fails to demonstrate consistent growth and sustainability is prohibited. This includes schemes or behaviors that do not align with responsible trading practices.
Deviating from Professional Standards: Traders must employ strategies and risk management techniques consistent with those they would use in a personally funded account at a registered broker. Apex does not fund traders who deviate from this standard.
Account and Resource Sharing: Sharing MAC addresses, computers, IPs, credit cards, or trade copying with other traders is strictly forbidden. Violations will result in account closure, forfeiture of funds, and potential additional verification or audits to ensure compliance.
Traders engaging in these prohibited activities will forfeit their accounts and all associated balances. Apex reserves the right to audit accounts further if there is a suspicion of non-compliance to guarantee adherence to the trader agreement.

By adhering to these guidelines, traders can maintain their accounts in good standing and demonstrate the consistent, disciplined approach Apex seeks to fund.

Account Probation Status
If your account is placed on probation, it signifies that specific compliance guidelines need your attention. To navigate this status, review the details of your probation in your member dashboard: Trader Probation

Understanding the compliance rules and the required next steps is essential to restore your account to good standing.

Consequences of Non-Compliance
If the account does not meet the requirements during the probation period, further action may be taken, including denial of payouts or account closure.

Remember: Probation is a chance to improve and prove that you can maintain a consistent, responsible trading strategy. By maintaining a consistent, disciplined approach to your trading during probation, you can restore your account to good standing and continue working towards a successful partnership with Apex Trader Funding.

Summary of Core Trading Rules
Use a Genuine Trading Strategy: Traders must employ a consistent, real-world trading strategy that aligns with live market conditions.
DCA (Dollar-Cost Averaging) is Allowed: DCA is permitted as long as it does not violate any other consistency rules (i.e. 30% profit in a day, 30% negative PnL, etc.).  DCA needs to be applied consistently and responsibly to satisfy the rules.
Flipping Trades is Allowed: Opening and closing trades quickly to count as a trading day is permitted, as long as the $50 minimum profit for 5 days is satisfied.
News Trading is Allowed (with Restrictions):
Trading based on news events is permitted; however, traders cannot take opposing positions (e.g., long and short) on the same news event.
News trading is permitted as long as it does not violate any other consistency rules (i.e. 30% profit in a day, 30% negative PnL, etc.). 
News trading needs to be applied consistently and responsibly to satisfy the rules.
Trade Half Contracts Until Trailing Stop is Achieved: Traders are limited to trading half of the available contracts until they meet the trailing stop threshold, encouraging careful risk management.
Maintain a 5:1 Risk-Reward Ratio on Trades: Ensure a maximum 5:1 risk-to-reward ratio on all trades. For instance, if targeting a profit of 10 ticks, the stop loss should not exceed 50 ticks.
Observe the 30% Negative PnL Limit (Adjustable to 50%):
Maintain a 30% drawdown limit based on the account’s profit balance. As the account grows, this limit may be adjusted to 50%, providing more flexibility as the account becomes more established.
Example: A trader starts with a 30% drawdown limit, which can be raised to 50% once their account balance meets specified growth conditions.
Practical Example: A trader adhering to a defined, consistent strategy, observing the half-contract limit until the trailing stop is cleared, maintaining a 5:1 risk-reward ratio, and ensuring no drawdown exceeds 30% (or 50% if eligible) would be considered fully compliant under Apex rules.
Finally, here is a video tutorial demonstrating how you can utilize the information on the PA Chart section of your Members' Dashboard.

Important Information on Apex Payout Methods and Procedures
At Apex, we prioritize accurate and timely payouts for all our traders and affiliates. To ensure smooth transactions, it’s crucial to follow the correct procedures when updating your payout method. Below, we’ve outlined key information and important reminders regarding payouts, including updates for non-U.S. traders and affiliates.

Payout Information: How to Request and Receive Your Payment
Apex Trader Funding provides different payout methods based on your location. Whether you're a U.S. or non-U.S. trader, it’s important to follow the correct process to ensure your payout is processed smoothly and accurately.

Payout Method Selection: U.S. vs. Non-U.S. Traders
For U.S. Traders:

Payout Method: Direct Deposit (ACH)
Payment Processing: U.S. traders will have their payments processed via ACH, using regional service providers.
Important ACH Reminder: Ensure you're using the correct ACH routing number for your bank account. ACH routing numbers and Wire Transfer numbers are often different, so verify you're using the correct one.
For Non-U.S. Traders:

Payout Method: International (via Plane)
Payment Processing: Non-U.S. traders will have their payments processed through Plane, a secure payment gateway. After your first request is approved, you will receive an invitation email from Plane to link your local bank. This ensures that subsequent payouts will be processed seamlessly.
Payout Requirements and Criteria
To request a payout, you must meet the following criteria to ensure smooth and compliant processing. These steps apply to both U.S. and non-U.S. traders.

8 Trading Days: You must have completed at least 8 trading days.
Profit on 5 Days: At least 5 of those 8 days must show a profit of $50 or more.
Safety Net for First Three Payouts: The safety net is calculated as your drawdown limit plus $100. This requirement applies to your first three payouts only. For more details, please refer to Safety Net Rules. 
Safety Net Requirement for First Three Payouts
Applicability: The safety net requirement applies to the first three approved payouts. It no longer applies from the fourth payout onward.
Definition: The safety net is the sum of the drawdown amount based on your account size plus $100.
Minimum Payout Exception: If the safety net threshold is met, you can request the minimum payout of $500, even if it exceeds the safety net amount.
Payouts Above Minimum:
To request more than the minimum, your balance must exceed the safety net threshold by the additional amount you wish to withdraw.
Example: For a $50,000 account with a drawdown of $2,500, the safety net is $2,600. If your balance is $52,600, you can request a minimum payout of $500. To request $1,200, your balance must be at least $53,300.
Required Minimum Balance to Request a Payout (“Safety Net”)
Your account must meet the required minimum balance to approve a payout, which includes surpassing the trailing drawdown level. The trailing drawdown in a PA account stops at the starting balance plus $100.

Minimum Required Balances:
Account Size	Minimum Required Balance
$25k Account	$26,600
$50k Account	$52,600
$100k Account	$103,100
$150k Account	$155,100
$250k Account	$256,600
$300k Account	$307,600
$100k Static	$102,600
Note: For a $50k account, you cannot request a payout if your balance is $52,000. It must be at least $52,600.

Minimum and Maximum Payout Amounts
Minimum Payout: $500 for any account size. You must have at least eight (8) trading days since the last request and meet the minimum required balance.
Maximum Payouts (First Five Payouts):
Account Size	Maximum Payout
$25k Account	$1,500
$50k Account	$2,000
$100k Account	$2,500
$150k Account	$2,750
$250k Account	$3,000
$300k Account	$3,500
$100k Static	$1,000
No Maximum After Sixth Payout: Starting from the sixth payout, there’s no maximum payout amount, provided the minimum balance threshold remains in the account after the payout.
100% Payout Eligibility Guidelines
To qualify for 100% payouts, traders must first complete five approved payouts. Starting with the sixth payout, you can withdraw 100% of your profits, even if you reach this milestone earlier than four months. By following a steady 8-day payout cycle, you can achieve this in as little as 48 trading days, providing full access to your profits in approximately two months.

Key Highlights:

Eligibility: Complete five approved payouts to access 100% of your profits from the sixth payout onward.
Faster Access: Achieve this in 48 trading days by maintaining an 8-day payout cycle.
Live Prop Accounts: Withdraw profits before the sixth payout if transferred to a Live Prop Account.
Existing Traders: If you’re already receiving 100% payouts or are in your third month, this update does not impact you.
By following these guidelines, you’ll have streamlined and faster access to your earnings, providing you with more control over your profits.

Probation and Payout Guidelines
If your account is placed on probation, it signifies that specific compliance guidelines need your attention. To navigate this status, review the details of your probation in your member dashboard: Trader Probation

Understanding the compliance rules and the required next steps is essential to restore your account to good standing.

Multiple Accounts and Payouts: Understanding the Benefits
At Apex Trader Funding, each account you manage is treated as a separate, stand-alone account. This allows you to maximize flexibility and opportunity when requesting payouts across multiple accounts.

How Payouts Work with Multiple Accounts
Separate Payouts: Each account operates independently, meaning you can request the maximum payout for each account during every eligible payout period.
Example Scenario:
Suppose you have ten (10) $50,000 accounts:
You can withdraw $2,000 from each account every 8 trading days, for a total of $20,000 across all accounts.
If you repeat this process over 16 trading days, you could withdraw a total of $40,000.
This independence allows you to scale your trading and withdrawals based on your overall account structure.

Benefits of Managing Multiple Accounts
Increased Earning Potential: By leveraging payouts from multiple accounts, you can optimize your income within the same trading periods.
Risk Management: Multiple accounts allow you to diversify your strategies and reduce the impact of losses on any single account.
Strategic Flexibility: Traders can apply different strategies to separate accounts, tailoring each to specific market conditions or goals.
For more information on why maintaining multiple accounts can be advantageous, check out our detailed guide: Benefits of Managing Multiple Accounts.

By managing multiple accounts responsibly, you can enhance both your trading opportunities and your payout potential.

How to Set Up Your Payout Method
To ensure smooth processing of your payouts, all traders must correctly set up their payout method in the Apex dashboard. The process is different for U.S. and non-U.S. traders, so follow the appropriate steps below based on your location.

Here’s what you need to do to set up your payout method:

Log in to your Apex dashboard.
Select Payout Method from the available options on your Apex dashboard.
Select International from the dropdown menu for Non-U.S. Traders.
Enter your personal details 
Select Direct Deposit from the dropdown menu for U.S. Traders.
Enter your bank details, including your ACH routing number and bank account number.
Important: Ensure you use the correct ACH routing number and not the wire transfer number.
Enter your payment details (bank information) and save.
For International traders, once you’ve completed these steps, your payout method will be set to International, and you’ll receive an invitation email from Plane to link your local bank account.

Company Payout Requests
For company payouts, fill out the payout form as follows:

First Name: Enter the company name (e.g., ABC Company LLC).
Please ensure there are no special characters or symbols.
Last Name: Enter Company to reflect the business entity.
How to Ensure Accurate Payout Processing
Matching Bank Country and Primary Residency: The country of your bank account must match your primary country of residency. For example:
If you live in the U.S., your bank account must also be based in the U.S.
If you live outside the U.S., your bank account must match the country where you reside.
Example 1: U.S. Resident
Residency: John Smith resides in Texas, U.S.
Bank Account: John provides the details of his U.S.-based bank account, including the ACH routing number, bank name, and account number.
Status: John’s payout request is approved because his bank country matches his residency, and his details are accurate.
Example 2: Non-U.S. Resident
Residency: Maria Lopez resides in Spain with a valid Spanish work permit.
Bank Account: Maria enters her details in the "International" section of the Payout Method and saves her details.
Status: Maria receives an email from Plane, links her account, and her payout is processed seamlessly.
Example 3: Mismatched Details
Residency: James Brown resides in Canada but lists a U.S.-based bank account.
Issue: The payout is rejected because the bank account country does not match his residency.
Resolution: James updates his details in the "International" section of the Payout Method and saves his details, and his request is approved.
Accuracy is Key: Make sure all information on your payout form is correct. Incorrect or incomplete details will result in delays or the rejection of your payout request. Ensure your ACH details are accurate before submitting your request.
How to Request Your Payout
To request your payout from Apex Trader Funding, follow these simple steps to ensure everything goes smoothly. Whether it’s your first time or you’ve requested payouts before, this process is quick and easy. Just make sure all the details are correct so we can get your payout processed without delay!

Log in to Your Apex Dashboard
First, head over to the Apex Trader Funding Dashboard. Use your login credentials to access your account.
Navigate to Payout Request
Once you're in your dashboard, look to the left-hand menu. You’ll see an option labeled Payout Request. Go ahead and click on it to start the process.
Follow the Prompts
After clicking on Payout Request, you'll be guided through a series of prompts. These are simple steps where you’ll enter details about your payout. Double-check everything—make sure the information matches your trading account and that there are no errors. Accuracy is key to ensuring your payout is processed without any issues.
Submit Your Request
Once you’ve reviewed everything and are confident the details are correct, go ahead and submit your payout request. That’s it! You're done!
What Happens Next?
Confirmation Email:
After submitting your payout request, the relevant department will review it to make sure everything is in order. Once it’s approved, you’ll receive a confirmation email confirming your request.
Check Your Spam or Junk Folder:
If you don’t see the confirmation email right away, don’t panic. Sometimes emails end up in your spam or junk folder. Be sure to check there if you can’t find it in your inbox.
Payout Request Processing and Timeline
Once you submit your payout request, it will undergo a structured review, approval, and transfer process. Below is a detailed explanation of each step to help you understand the timeline and what to expect during the payout process.

Payout Request Submission and Review: Once you submit your payout request, it will be reviewed and either approved or denied within 2 business days, depending on the demand and any holidays. During peak periods, the review time may vary slightly.
If your payout is denied, you’ll be informed of the reasons for the denial, and you can make the necessary adjustments for future payout requests.
Funds Transfer Initiation:  After your payout is approved, the funds will be transferred to your selected payout method. The funds transfer will generally be initiated within 3-4 business days after approval. The processing time for transferring the funds depends on the payment method you’ve selected.
For U.S. traders, this is typically ACH (Automated Clearing House), and the funds will be transferred to your U.S. bank account.
For non-U.S. traders, payments are processed via Plane (a payment gateway), and additional steps will be involved (detailed below).
Funds Arrival: After the transfer is initiated, it can take an additional 3-7 business days for the funds to appear in your bank account, depending on your bank’s processing time. Banks may take varying amounts of time to process and reflect the incoming payment, so it’s essential to check with your bank for specific timing.
International Payments via Plane: For non-U.S. traders, once your payout request is approved, you will receive an invitation email from Plane, typically within 1-4 business days, depending on the volume of requests. Follow the instructions in the email to link your bank account. 
Be sure to check your spam or junk folders in case the invitation email ends up there.
After linking your account, Plane will process the payment, which usually takes 3-7 business days for completion.
Important Reminders:

Do NOT Submit Help Desk Tickets Immediately After Payout Request:
Please do not submit a Help Desk ticket immediately after updating your payout method or once your payout request is approved. Invitation emails are sent at different points during the processing period, not immediately.
Payment Status – PAID:
Once your payout is marked as PAID in the system, it means the funds have been successfully sent to your Plane account (for non-U.S. traders) or your bank account (for U.S. traders). The funds will be available once processing is complete.
Tax Information for Apex Trader Funding Payouts
Understanding the tax requirements for your payouts is essential. Below are the tax guidelines for U.S. and non-U.S. traders, along with recommendations for managing your tax obligations.

For U.S. Citizens and Entities
Contractor Status: U.S. citizens and entities are paid as individual contractors.
Tax Form: You will receive a 1099-NEC form by January 31 each year for tax reporting purposes.
Responsibility: Ensure you include your Apex income in your annual tax filings as per IRS regulations.
For Non-U.S. Citizens
No Tax Reports: Non-U.S. citizens do not receive tax forms or reports from Apex Trader Funding.
Tax Filing Responsibility: You are responsible for adhering to the tax laws in your country of residence regarding income earned from Apex.
Tax Advice and Inquiries
Tax Advice: Apex cannot provide tax advice. For questions related to taxes, filings, citizenship, or work visas, consult a qualified tax advisor.
Help Desk Policy: The Apex Help Desk is unable to assist with tax-related inquiries. Please do not submit tax questions to the Help Desk.
By understanding these tax requirements and seeking guidance from a professional, you can ensure compliance with your local tax regulations while trading with Apex Trader Funding.

Navigating the landscape of paid and funded trading accounts can be complex, especially when managing multiple accounts across different platforms and entities. Apex Trader Funding provides a structured approach to managing these accounts, ensuring consistency and compliance. This article outlines the key policies and functionalities associated with Paid Accounts (PA) and Evaluation Accounts, helping traders maximize their potential while adhering to Apex Trader Funding’s guidelines.

PA Account Fees and Payment Options
At Apex, managing your Performance Account (PA) accounts is streamlined with clear fee structures and payment options designed to suit your trading needs. Whether you're a new trader or managing multiple accounts, it's essential to understand the lifetime and monthly fee options, activation procedures, and billing processes to make informed decisions. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of PA account fees, payment options, and essential procedures to ensure a smooth experience with Apex.

How the PA Account Process Works:
Pass the Evaluation Before the Renewal Date: To qualify for a refund of the evaluation renewal fee, you must pass your evaluation at least one day before the renewal date.
Activate the PA Account Within 48 Hours: Once you've passed the evaluation, you must activate your PA account within 48 hours. This includes signing the agreement and paying the PA fee.
If the renewal fee was paid before you passed the evaluation or activated the PA account, the renewal fee is unfortunately not eligible for a refund, as the system processes renewals automatically and requires both the evaluation to be passed and the PA account to be activated within the proper time frame.

What Happens After You Activate Your PA Account:
Once your PA account is activated, the following changes will occur:

Evaluation Account Cancelation: Your passed evaluation account will be automatically canceled, and any monthly evaluation fees associated with it will be waived.
Monthly PA Fees: Depending on the platform you choose, the monthly fees are:
Rithmic: $85 per month
Tradovate: $105 per month
Alternatively, you can choose a Lifetime PA Fee, which varies based on the account size. This one-time fee covers all future costs for non-professional traders.
NinjaTrader License: You’ll continue to have access to a free NinjaTrader License Key for the duration of your account.
For more detailed information about PA fees, billing, and payment options, visit: PA Fees.

Understanding Trading Days and System Updates
A trading day is defined from 6 PM ET one day to 4:59 PM ET the next day. The system updates overnight to recognize the previous completed trading day. For instance, after completing seven days of trading and passing the Evaluation, the system will acknowledge this on the morning of the eighth day, initiating the process to email you the paperwork for the PA Account.

Monitoring Your Progress:

PA Charts: Check your trading days and account statuses in your member's area under "PA Charts."
Updates: The PA Charts display statistics from the previous day and refresh every 24 hours to ensure you have the most current information. Watch the video below to see how you can utilize the information in the PA Charts.

What Happens if I Fail a Paid Performance Account?
At Apex, we understand that the journey to becoming a successful trader involves challenges, including the possibility of not meeting the requirements of a Funded or Paid Performance Account (PA). To support our traders through these setbacks, we have established clear policies and supportive measures to ensure that you can continue striving toward your trading goals without unnecessary burdens. This guide outlines what happens if you fail a Funded or PA account, the status of your NinjaTrader license key, and the steps you can take to restart your evaluation process with advantageous discounts.

Failing a Paid Performance (PA) Account at Apex triggers a specific set of procedures designed to maintain clarity and fairness for all traders. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of what occurs and what actions you should take:

Automatic Subscription Cancelation 
Account Cancelation: If you fail a PA, the system will automatically cancel your account.
Recurring Fee Cancelation: The account and any recurring PA fees associated with it will also be canceled.
Verification: Log in to your member's area to ensure that the cancellation has been processed. Check that both the account and the PA fee have been successfully canceled to avoid any further charges.
Important Note: If you cancel your PA invoice, your account will be deactivated at the expiry date of the billing cycle. This is an irreversible action, and we cannot reactivate invoices that are canceled. Please move with caution when canceling account invoices. You should never need to cancel a PA invoice, as it is done automatically once the account breaches the drawdown.
Restarting the Evaluation Process
Begin Again: After confirming the cancellation, you can start the evaluation process anew. Sign up for another evaluation account to continue your path toward securing a PA. Note: Check your emails for the Breached PA email with an exclusive discount for a new evaluation.
No Restrictions on Attempts: Failing a PA does not prevent you from trying again. Unlike other companies that impose hefty reset fees ranging from $500 to $1,700, Apex offers more favorable terms to our members.
Exclusive Discounts for Restarting Evaluations
Apex is committed to supporting our traders by offering significant discounts to facilitate your continued evaluations:

Unique Discount Code: After failing a PA, you will receive an email containing a unique code.
Evaluation Discount: This code grants you an 80% discount for one month on an evaluation and 50% off for every subsequent recurring month.
One-Time Use: The discount applies to ONE evaluation on any account size.
Expiration: The coupon code must be used within seven (7) calendar days after the PA failure and cannot be reactivated once expired.
Email Timing: You should expect to receive the discount email sometime after 1:00 AM ET the day after your PA Account fails.
Unlimited Evaluation Resets
Flexible Attempts: You can reset and restart your evaluation accounts as many times as necessary to achieve success.
PA Account Limitations: While PA Accounts cannot be reset once failed, evaluation accounts remain flexible, allowing you to continuously work towards meeting the performance criteria.
Failed a Funded Account: What Happens to Your NinjaTrader License Key?
If you fail a Funded Account at Apex, it’s important to know that the NinjaTrader license key is not associated with specific accounts. Your user profile needs an active account/subscription to continue accessing the NinjaTrader License Key. If you fail your PA and have no other active accounts, then you will lose the license key, including the default NinjaTrader SIM Account. The license key is not a lifetime key; instead, it is tied directly to your member account. Here’s what you need to do if you have no other active accounts/subscriptions:

Restart the Evaluation Process: Upon failing a Funded Account, you must initiate a new evaluation account to regain access to your NinjaTrader license key.
Additional Support and Resources
To further assist you in navigating the process of restarting your evaluation and maximizing your chances of success, Apex provides additional resources:

Help Desk Assistance: If you encounter any issues or have questions about the cancelation process or discounts, our help desk is available to support you. However, please note that they cannot make exceptions to the established policies.

Reminders
No Lifetime License Keys: Remember that NinjaTrader license keys are tied to specific user accounts and are not transferable after account expiration.
Timely Use of Discounts: Utilize your unique discount code within the seven-day window to take advantage of significant savings on your next evaluation.
Continuous Effort: Persistence is key. Take advantage of the flexible evaluation resets to hone your trading skills and meet the necessary criteria for a successful PA Account.
Stay Informed: Regularly check your emails and the members’ area for updates, discount codes, and important notifications regarding your accounts.
By understanding and adhering to these procedures, you can effectively manage the challenges of failed Funded and PA Accounts at Apex. Our supportive policies and generous discounts are designed to help you overcome setbacks and continue your journey toward trading success with confidence and financial prudence.

PA Account Benefits and Guidelines
Allowed Number of Performance Accounts (PAs)
At Apex Trader Funding, traders are allowed to manage one Member Account and one Business Member Account, with a total of up to 20 Funded Performance Accounts (PAs) collectively under those accounts. Traders can also have multiple Evaluation Account subscriptions within the same Member Account to test and refine their strategies before transitioning to a funded account.

Account Structure Breakdown
One Member Account: Each trader is permitted to have one Member Account to manage their subscription accounts.
One Business Member Account: If applicable, you can also have one Business Member Account to manage Performance Accounts (PAs) and Evaluation Accounts under a business entity.
Performance Accounts (PAs): You can hold up to 20 PA accounts under a single Member or Business Member Account, collectively.
A total of 20 PA accounts within the same household.
Evaluation Accounts: Evaluation Accounts are unlimited, allowing traders to test and refine strategies before transitioning to a funded account. These do not count toward the 20 PA account limit.
Example Scenario for PA Accounts:

Member Account:

Rithmic PA Subscriptions: 3 PA accounts are held under the Member Account.
Tradovate PA Subscriptions: 4 PA accounts are held under the Member Account.
Business Member Account:

Rithmic PA Subscriptions: 5 PA accounts are held under the Business Member Account.
Spouse/Significant Other:

8 PA accounts are held under their own Member or Business Member Account.

In this scenario, the total number of PA accounts across both the Member Account, Business Member Account, and Spouse/Significant Other would be 20, which is the maximum allowed.

Important Notes:

Evaluation Accounts: These accounts are unlimited and are separate from the 20 PA account limit. You can use them to test strategies before applying for a funded account.
Adherence to Limits: Ensure that you don’t exceed 20 PA accounts across your Member Account, Business Member Account, and any accounts held by your Spouse/Significant Other residing within the same household. Exceeding this limit will result in the forfeiture of excess accounts
By following these guidelines, you can scale your trading with multiple PA accounts, while still complying with Apex’s rules and maintaining account integrity.

Trading Guidelines
After you pass your evaluation and pay the PA activation fee (monthly or lifetime), you will receive a new PA account that matches your passed evaluation; this includes a fresh account balance corresponding to the starting balance of the passed evaluation. 

Trade Closure Requirement: Daily Trade Closure: All trades must be closed, and any pending orders must be canceled by 4:59 PM EST each day. This ensures that your account remains compliant with the trading rules.
For a more detailed understanding of the process and guidelines, refer to the PA Rules Article here.

Contract Size Limits in PA Accounts
Traders are encouraged to trade up to the maximum allowed contracts based on the limits of their Performance Account (PA), in accordance with the Contract Size Consistency Rule. However, increasing the number of contracts within a single PA account beyond the permitted maximum limit is not allowed.

If additional trading capacity is required, traders can open, pass, and activate a new evaluation account that aligns with the desired contract size limits. This allows for scaling trading activity while maintaining compliance with Apex’s contract size consistency rules.

It's important to note that all trades must remain consistent with your defined strategy. Any attempt to adjust contract sizes recklessly or without a strategic rationale, particularly to chase profits or use windfall strategies, will result in non-compliance with the consistency rules.

By following these rules, traders can scale their trading responsibly and effectively while maintaining integrity and compliance with Apex’s performance account policies.

Payout Limits and Withdrawal Policies
Apex Trader Funding implements specific payout limits to ensure proper risk management and consistent trading practices. These limits apply to approved payouts during the early stages of your trading journey:

Payouts One to Three: Traders must maintain a Safety Net. This safety net ensures that a buffer equal to the drawdown amount plus $100 remains in the account for the first three payouts.
Max Withdrawal: Payouts for the first three approved payouts are capped at a maximum amount to ensure proper risk management.
Payouts Four to Five: Traders are no longer required to maintain a Safety Net, however, the maximum withdrawal limit for these payouts continues to apply.
Sixth Payout and Beyond: Starting with the sixth approved payout, traders can withdraw 100% of their profits, regardless of whether this is achieved earlier than four months.
Live Prop Account Transition: If you transition to a Live Prop Account, you can begin withdrawals before reaching the sixth payout.
Existing PA Holders: Traders already at 100% or in their third month will not be impacted by these changes and can continue trading as per the existing rules.
Withdrawal Schedule
Frequency: Payouts can be requested and received every 8 complete trading days, provided the trader has earned a profit of at least $50 on 5 or more of those days. Once a payout request is submitted, the 8-day payout period starts over again from the submission date. 
If a payout is denied, the profits earned are not lost. The trader can continue to trade, and once they meet the required criteria again (e.g., profit of $50 on at least 5 trading days), they can reapply for a payout. The trader must simply continue to trade and align their performance with PA rules, improving their chances of qualifying for the next payout.
Profit Sharing: Traders retain 100% of the first $25,000 in profits and 90% of any profits earned above that threshold.
For more detailed information on the payout process and policies, refer to the Payout Policies.

Optimizing Your Trading Potential with Apex Trader Funding
Apex Trader Funding offers a comprehensive framework for managing Performance and Evaluation Accounts, with a strong focus on consistency, risk management, and long-term growth.

By adhering to account limits, understanding the features of PA accounts, respecting payout and withdrawal policies, and following trading restrictions, traders can optimize their potential and build a sustainable trading career.

Whether you manage multiple accounts or focus on a single account, Apex Trader Funding provides the necessary tools and guidelines to support you throughout your trading journey.

Managing your Apex Trader Funding account effectively involves understanding the billing structure, fees, and processes. This guide consolidates key information to help you navigate account setup, billing, and related questions seamlessly.

30-Day Billing Cycle: How It Works
At Apex Trader Funding, we operate on an automatic 30-day billing cycle for your account subscriptions. Here’s what you need to know:

Automatic Renewal:
Your account subscription renews automatically every 30 days from the date you make your payment for either an Evaluation Account or a Performance Account, where a monthly fee is selected.
The billing will continue as long as the account subscription is active, regardless of whether you pass or fail the account, until you choose to cancel. Please be aware that Performance Accounts will auto-cancel upon failure.
Account Status:
Evaluation Accounts: If your Evaluation Account fails, the account subscription remains active. You can continue with the same subscription to test again without interruption.
Performance Accounts: If your Performance Account fails, the account subscription is automatically canceled. You will need to create a new subscription to continue.
Balance Reset:
Balances for Evaluation Accounts are not reset monthly unless the account fails before the renewal date. If an account fails, the balance is reset automatically at no extra charge.
Account Subscription Management:
You can manage your account subscriptions directly through the Apex dashboard to prevent unnecessary renewals or interruptions.
Managing Subscriptions After Cancelation: If an account subscription is canceled, the account will remain active until the expiration date. To reactivate, you will need to start a new subscription. Visit this guide for help: Account Cancelation.
Accessing Real-Time Data After Account Failure: For Rithmic accounts, real-time data remains accessible for 7 days after an account fails. Tradovate accounts lose real-time access within 24 hours. To restore access to data, you can either purchase a reset or create a new subscription. For more details, visit: Failed Renewals
Fees and Charges: A Transparent Breakdown
At Apex Trader Funding, we provide a clear and structured fee system to help you manage your trading expenses effectively. Here's everything you need to know about the costs associated with your account subscriptions.

Initial Fees
The initial fee is determined by the plan you select. Each plan offers unique features tailored to different trading needs.
For detailed pricing and plan options, please visit the Apex Trader Funding website.
Monthly Fees
Your monthly account subscription fee grants full access to your Evaluation Account and includes the following benefits:

Performance Tracking: Monitor and evaluate your trading progress.
Real-Time Data Feed: Access live market data, as long as your account is active.
NinjaTrader Platform License Key: Trade seamlessly using one of the industry’s leading platforms.
No additional purchases are required to trade within your Evaluation Account, ensuring you have all the tools you need to get started.

Important Reminder:

Failed Evaluation Account Subscriptions: These accounts do not automatically cancel upon failure. If you no longer wish to continue, you must manually cancel the subscription to avoid further charges.
To learn more about managing failed accounts, visit Reset Options and Invoice Cancelations.
By understanding these fees and actively managing your subscriptions, you can focus on your trading journey without unexpected charges.

Add-ons and Optional Fees
In addition to the standard account subscription fees, traders have the option to purchase add-ons for enhanced data and trading features. Below is a detailed breakdown of the available optional fees for Rithmic and Tradovate users:

Optional Account Fees:
Reset Fee: If you fail your Evaluation Account and wish to start over, a reset fee will apply. To learn more, visit Reset Options.
PA Activation Fees: When you pass your Evaluation Account and transition to a Performance Account (PA), an activation fee applies. For detailed information about PA activation fees, refer to PA Account Fees and Payment Options.
Rithmic Add-Ons:
Enhance your trading experience with optional Rithmic add-ons, such as market depth tools and additional login sessions. For a full list of available add-ons, their descriptions, and how to purchase them, visit our support guide: Rithmic Trading Tools & Add-ons.

Tradovate Add-Ons:
Enhance your Tradovate account with optional data feeds, such as CME Bundle—Depth of Market (Level 2) and EUREX—Depth of Market (Level 2), which provide detailed Level 2 market data for these exchanges. For more information on available add-ons and how to purchase them, visit our support guide: Tradovate Trading Tools & Add-ons.

Coupon Codes: How to Use Them
How to Apply a Coupon

Before completing the transaction, double-check that the discounted price is correctly applied to your order. This ensures you get the savings immediately.
Missed Coupons or Discounts

Renewal Billing: Everything You Need to Know
Managing your account subscription renewals with Apex Trader Funding is straightforward. Below are the key details and steps to ensure uninterrupted access to your accounts.

Billing Schedule
Billing occurs on the subscription start date and recurs every 30 days.
To check your next billing date, log in to your Apex Trader Funding Dashboard, which displays all active subscriptions and renewal dates.
Separate invoices are generated for each paid or funded account subscription.


Balance and Drawdown
Balance and Drawdown
Your cash balance and drawdown carry forward each month unless your account is in a failed status.
Failed Accounts:
Accounts in a failed status are automatically reset at no extra cost during the renewal process.
To qualify for this reset, the Evaluation Account must fail before 5 PM ET on the trading day before the invoice renewal date. Otherwise, the account will not be reset, and balances will remain unchanged.
Renewal Issues
By staying informed about your renewal process and ensuring your payment details are updated, you can enjoy uninterrupted trading with Apex Trader Funding.

Payment Method: Ensure your credit card information is up to date to avoid disruptions in the renewal process.


Missed Invoices: If an invoice renewal fails, you can manually renew it by:
Logging into the Apex dashboard.
Navigating to the Payment History section.
Locating the failed invoice and clicking Manually Renew.
For step-by-step instructions, refer to: How to Manually Renew Your Account.
Credit Card Payments: A Comprehensive Guide
Managing your payments with Apex Trader Funding is simple and efficient. Follow these guidelines to ensure seamless transactions and uninterrupted account access.

Accepted Payment Methods
Apex Trader Funding accepts Visa, Mastercard, and Discover for all transactions.
Card Management
To update or change your card:
Log in to your Apex Trader Funding Dashboard.
Click on the Update Credit Card link.
Follow the on-screen instructions to save your new card details.
Important Note: Any new purchase made using the CIM processor automatically updates the card on file for future billing.
Card Usage Rules
You must use your own card for all fees, resets, or PA account payments.
If your card is rejected, you must update it before the renewal date to retain balances and avoid interruptions.
Handling Declined Payments
Declined payments can occur due to various reasons, including bank restrictions or incorrect billing details. Here’s how to troubleshoot:

Error 609 (Transaction Blocked by Issuer):

This error typically indicates that your bank has flagged the transaction for security reasons.
What to Do:
Contact your bank directly to authorize the payment.
Confirm that your card can process online or international transactions if applicable.
Billing Information:

Ensure that the billing address and personal details entered match those associated with your card.
Retrying the Payment:

Once your bank has authorized the payment, retry the transaction through your Apex Dashboard. Ensure all details are accurate. Please visit this guide for more details: Renew Manually.
If the issue persists, update your payment method with a different card to avoid disruptions.

Avoiding Duplicate Payment Errors
This error occurs when a payment is retried too quickly after a failed attempt or when the same transaction is processed multiple times within a short time frame. To avoid this, wait a few minutes before attempting the payment again.

Final Reminders
Plan your trading and billing schedule carefully to prevent disruptions.
For any account-related issues, please submit a help desk ticket through the official Apex Trader Funding Helpdesk website.

Reset Options and Invoice Cancellations

Updated 29 days ago
Not yet followed by anyone
In your trading journey, you might encounter situations where your evaluation account becomes inactive due to breaking a rule—such as reaching the maximum drawdown threshold. When this happens, an error message stating, “Trades Can Only Be Placed By Administrator,” may appear. If you wish to continue trading within your subscription period, you have the option to reset your account. This article provides detailed information on how to reset your evaluation account, our policies regarding resets, and important considerations to keep in mind.

Resetting Your Evaluation Account
When to Reset
If your evaluation account becomes inactive because you’ve broken a rule, you can choose to reset it. Resetting allows you to start fresh with a full balance, full trailing drawdown, and zero days traded. 

How to Reset
To reset your account:

Close All Positions: Before initiating a reset, ensure that all open positions are closed.
Purchase a Reset:
Log In: Access your members’ area here.
Select Account: Click on Reset next to the account you wish to reset.
Warning: Make sure you reset the correct account, as this action is irreversible.
Processing Time: The system typically processes resets within 10 minutes, but processing times may vary.


 

Important Notes on Resetting
Understanding how resets work is essential for managing your Apex Trader Funding accounts effectively. Below are the key guidelines and considerations to keep in mind when resetting an account:

Renewal Date Unchanged
Resets do not extend your renewal or expiration date.
Your renewal date remains exactly 30 days from the last billing date, regardless of resets.
Resetting a Canceled Evaluation Account
If your Evaluation Account was canceled but is still within the subscription period, it can be reset manually to restore its balance and parameters.
Resets do not reactivate canceled subscriptions or change renewal dates.
Important: If an Evaluation Account is canceled, it must be converted to a Performance Account (PA) within the 30-day rebill period. Once the rebill date passes, the account can no longer be converted to a PA.
Refund Policy
No Refunds: Reset fees are non-refundable, even if the reset was made by mistake.
Resetting Passed Accounts
DO NOT reset a passed account.
This action is irreversible, and you will permanently lose any progress made.
If you reset a passed account, you will need to start over with a fresh balance.
Impact of Resetting
A reset will restore:
Your drawdown.
Your initial balance.
Your accumulated trading days.
However, a reset does not change your renewal date.
Resetting The Same Account Multiple Times
If you reset an account (e.g., APEX-12345-12) and it generates a new account number (e.g., APEX-12345-13), then reset it again to APEX-12345-14 without taking any trades on account -13, you will not be eligible for a refund. This is considered a user error.
To Avoid Issues:
Always ensure you have traded and failed on the previous account (e.g., -13) before resetting.
Keep track of which accounts you have traded and failed to avoid resetting an unused account.
No Penalty for Resetting
You can reset your accounts as many times as needed without any penalties.
By following these guidelines, you can effectively manage your resets while avoiding common mistakes. Always track your accounts carefully and ensure you’re adhering to these rules to avoid unnecessary complications.

Our Policy on Resets Upon Monthly Auto-Renewal
Apex Trader Funding's reset policy is designed to simplify the process for traders and minimize unnecessary fees. If your Evaluation Account fails and you forget to cancel your subscription, a free reset will be applied automatically upon renewal, provided certain conditions are met. This guide explains the process and helps you manage resets effectively.

Conditions for Free Reset Upon Renewal
Account Status: To qualify for the free reset, the account must be in failed status as of the market close prior to the renewal date.
Successful Renewal Fee: The subscription renewal fee must be successfully charged. The free reset applies only when the renewal payment is processed.
Automatic Process: The reset will happen automatically after the renewal. No action is required on your part.
Options Before Renewal
If you don’t want to wait for the automatic reset, you have two alternatives:

Manual Reset: You can manually reset your account before the renewal date by paying the reset fee ($80 for Rithmic accounts / $100 for Tradovate accounts).
Cancel and Sign Up for a New Account: You can choose to cancel your current account subscription and sign up for a new one. This prevents you from being charged for both a renewal and a reset fee, especially if you wish to take advantage of any available discount promotions.
Important Considerations
No Retroactive Resets: If you reset your account manually before the renewal date and then it renews, you will not receive a refund for the reset fee.

Evaluation Accounts Only: This policy applies exclusively to Evaluation Accounts. Performance Accounts (PAs) are not eligible for auto-resets.

Subsequent Failures: If your account fails again after the reset, it will not be reset for free unless it renews while in a failed status.

Multiple Resets: Resets are only free upon renewal when the account is in a failed status. If you fail an active account and reset it, additional resets will require payment.

This policy is designed to assist traders who might forget to cancel their accounts and sign up for new ones with available discount promotions. By automatically resetting failed accounts upon renewal, traders avoid having to pay both a renewal fee and a reset fee.

Account Cancelation Policy
Canceling your Apex Trader Funding account is simple, but it’s essential to fully understand the implications and steps involved. This guide explains everything you need to know, presented in a clear and visual format, to help you avoid mistakes and manage your accounts effectively.

Cancelation Policy
Validity Until Expiration: If you cancel your account or we cancel it due to a declined card, it remains valid until the expiration date. However, the account cannot be renewed once it is canceled.

No Reinstatement: An account cannot be reinstated once it has been canceled. If you want to continue trading, you’ll need to start a new subscription.

Consider Before Canceling: Be sure you want to cancel your account, as profits and trading days cannot be transferred or rolled over to a new account. Cancelations are irreversible.

Key Points About Cancelations
Feature	Details
Canceled accounts stay active until they expire, but renewals are not possible after that.	
The account will expire at the end of the current billing period. This action is irreversible.

No Reinstatement	Once an account is canceled, it cannot be reactivated.
Profits & Days Traded	These cannot be transferred to a new account after cancellation.
What Happens After Cancellation?
Your account remains active until the end of the billing cycle, but cannot be renewed.
Once the rebill date passes, the account can no longer be converted to a PA. You must sign and pay for the account at least one day prior to the rebill date.
Any profits or trading days accumulated on the account will be forfeited.
 
Managing Multiple Subscriptions
Scenario	Action to Take
Canceling One Account	Double-check the account name before clicking cancel to avoid errors.
Unsure Which Account to Cancel	Contact the Help Desk for clarification before taking any action.
Failed Accounts	These remain active unless canceled manually, so cancel them to avoid unintended charges.
What if I Cancel by Mistake?
Mistaken Cancelation Is Final
If you cancel an account by mistake, you will need to start a new subscription.
Canceled accounts cannot be reactivated or reinstated.
Avoiding Subscription Overcharges
Accounts in a failed state will remain active and incur charges unless manually canceled.
Prevent Unwanted Charges: Cancel unused accounts before market close on the day before the renewal date to avoid unnecessary billing.
How to Cancel an Account
Log In

Access your Apex Trader Funding website dashboard.
Select the Account

Click Cancel next to the subscription you wish to terminate.
Timing is Key

Cancelations must be completed before market close on the day prior to the renewal date to avoid charges.


Important Notes
Irreversible Action: Cancelations are final and cannot be reversed. Make sure you're absolutely sure about your decision before proceeding.

Evaluation Accounts: If an Evaluation Account is canceled, it must be converted to a Performance Account (PA) before the rebill date. Once the rebill date passes, it can no longer be converted to a PA



Special Notes for Rithmic Users
You can remove canceled accounts from your Rithmic Dashboard via the Apex Trader Funding member dashboard.
Caution: Once removed, these accounts become inactive, and you can no longer trade or convert them to PA accounts.




Summary
Canceling an account is straightforward, but it requires careful attention to avoid errors. Remember, once an account is canceled, it cannot be reinstated. If you are unsure or need guidance, reach out to the Apex Trader Funding Help Desk before proceeding. By following these steps, you can manage your subscriptions effectively and avoid unnecessary charges or disruptions.

What is the Affiliate Commission Payout Schedule?
For Apex Referring Affiliates:

Commission reports for Affiliates occur on the first of every month.  Payouts for the previous time period happen by the 15th of the current month.  

Example: Commissions from August 1-31 will show up on the report generated on September 1. We will make the payment by the 15th of the month.

 

We will send out payments by the 15th of the month. However, reaching your bank account may take 3-7 BUSINESS days.

 

*** Please DO NOT submit a ticket asking where your funds are until 7 BUSINESS days after we release them. Please allow an additional 3–7 business days for the credit to post to your account; the timeframe depends on your bank.

 

Commission Payout Schedule
Apex Trader Funding maintains a transparent and structured commission payout schedule for its referring affiliates:

Monthly Reports: Commission reports detailing earnings from the previous month are generated on the first day of each month. For example, commissions earned from August 1-31 will appear in the report generated on September 1.
Payout Timeline: Payments are processed by the 15th of the current month following the report generation. Using the previous example, the $100 commission from August will be paid by September 15.
Processing Time: Once released, payouts typically take 3-7 business days to reach your bank account. Different financial institutions may vary in processing times.
Important: Do not submit a help desk ticket about your funds until 7 business days after we release the payment. This allows sufficient time for the transaction to reflect in your account.

Minimum Affiliate Payout Requirements
Apex Trader Funding requires a minimum payout balance of $100. If your monthly commissions do not meet this threshold, the amount will carry over to subsequent months until the total reaches $100. For instance:

June Commission: If you earn $30 in June, no payout will occur on July 15 since the total is below $100.
July Commission: Earning an additional $80 in July brings the cumulative total to $110, which will be paid out on August 15.
Affiliate commissions work the same for Tradovate and Rithmic plans.

For day traders, every millisecond counts. Ensuring your computer runs at peak performance can make the difference between a profitable trade and a missed opportunity. Here are some helpful tips.

What are the ideal computer specifications for day trading?
To handle the demands of trading platforms, live data feeds, and charting tools, aim for the following specs:

Processor: Multi-core CPUs (e.g., Intel i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7/9) with a high clock speed (3.5 GHz or higher is preferred).
RAM: At least 16GB; 32GB or more is preferable for multitasking.
Storage: SSD (Solid State Drive) for faster data access and system performance.
Graphics Card: A dedicated GPU, such as an NVIDIA GTX/RTX series, or AMD RX series, is recommended for smooth chart rendering.
Network: High-speed internet with low latency (fiber-optic is ideal). Consider using a wired Ethernet connection instead of Wi-Fi.
How can I optimize NinjaTrader 8 (NT8) for a better performance?
NinjaTrader 8 users can take the following steps to improve performance:

Limit Historical Data: Load only the data you need for your analysis to reduce memory usage.
Use Efficient Chart Settings: Avoid complex chart styles or excessive indicators that consume resources.
Disable Unused Workspaces: Close unused workspaces to free up system memory.
Restart Regularly: Restart NT8 and your computer daily to clear memory and temporary files.
More general Ninjatrader Performance Tips can be found here: NT8 Performance Optimization Guide.

Measuring and Reducing Lag in NinjaTrader (NT8)
Lag can significantly impact your trading performance. Regularly measuring and addressing lag ensures your data flows smoothly.

Using the NT8 Lag Analyzer
For Rithmic/Tradovate account users, the NT8 Lag Analyzer tool is invaluable in identifying internet lag issues.

Download the Tool: Obtain the NT8 Lag Analyzer from the provided link.
Import the Add-On:
Open NinjaTrader.
Navigate to Tools > Import > NinjaScript Add-On.
Browse and select the downloaded zip folder without extracting it.
Configure Market Analyzer:
Go to New > Market Analyzer.
Right-click on a blank space and select Columns.
Double-click the NeuroStreet folder and choose NS_DataLagTimer.
Click OK to apply.
Add Instruments: Click on an empty space within the Market Analyzer and add the instruments you wish to monitor for lag.


Fixing Lagging Data in NinjaTrader (NT8)
If you notice data lag, follow these steps to mitigate the issue:

Reset the Database:
Go to Tools > Database > Reset Database in NinjaTrader.
Re-establish Rithmic/Tradovate Connection:
Delete your existing connection to Rithmic/Tradovate and add it back.
Consider using IQFeed for Futures data, which offers faster and more stable connections, albeit at a cost.
Clear Cache:
Shut down NinjaTrader.
Navigate to Documents > NinjaTrader 8 > db and delete the cache folder.
Restart NinjaTrader and test the connection.
Open in Safe Mode:
Hold the Ctrl key while launching NinjaTrader to open it in Safe Mode.
Verify the mode under the Help section.
Close and reopen NinjaTrader normally.
Disable Tick Refresh on Charts:
Open your workspace.
Disconnect and remove tick refresh from all charts.
Re-save your workspace, reconnect to data, and reload.
Ensure Adequate System Performance:
Verify that your computer meets the minimum benchmark of 30k. Watch the instructional video below for guidance on checking your system’s performance.

How can I reduce lag caused by time synchronization issues?
Accurate time synchronization is crucial for aligning trades with market events. Use a reliable time-sync program to ensure your PC’s clock matches the official market time:

Recommended Tools:
Atomic Clock by WorldTimeServer.com
Time Sync by Vovsoft
Time-Sync by MajorGeeks
Disclaimer: We are not liable for any issues that may arise from downloading or installing third-party time synchronization tools. Use them at your own risk.

Configure these tools to sync your system clock with an accurate time server, such as NTP (Network Time Protocol).

What maintenance tasks should I perform to keep my computer running smoothly?
Regular maintenance ensures your computer operates at peak efficiency:

Update: Keep your operating system, drivers, and trading software up-to-date.
Uninstall: Remove unnecessary programs and applications to free up resources.
Back-Up: Regularly back up critical files to a secure location.
Run Scans: Perform antivirus scans to protect against malware.
Organize: Tidy up your workspace and organize cables to improve accessibility and airflow.
Optimize Browser: Clear browser cache and disable unnecessary extensions if you use web-based platforms.
Defragment: For HDD users, defragment regularly; SSD users should avoid defragmentation but ensure TRIM is enabled.
How can I optimize my internet connection for trading?
A fast and stable internet connection is critical for day trading. Follow these tips:

Use Ethernet: Connect directly to your router with an Ethernet cable to minimize latency.
Test Speed: Run regular speed tests and aim for a download speed of 50 Mbps or higher. You can do so here.
Ping Test: Check latency to ensure it’s below 20ms for trading servers. You can do so here.
What other general tips can help reduce trading lag?
Disable Background Programs: Close unnecessary applications and browser tabs during trading hours.
Upgrade Your Hardware: As mentioned before, consider upgrading components like your RAM or CPU if your system struggles.
Cooling: Proper ventilation is key; it prevents overheating and performance issues.
Power Settings: Set your PC to “High Performance” mode in power settings.
By following these guidelines, you can ensure your computer is optimized for day trading, giving you the best chance to stay competitive in the fast-paced world of financial markets.

Navigating the complexities of trading accounts involves understanding various processes, from evaluations and subscriptions to compliance statuses. Whether you’re managing your Apex account or utilizing platforms like NinjaTrader, it’s essential to stay informed to ensure seamless trading operations. This guide provides comprehensive insights into managing your trading account effectively.

Canceling a Passed Evaluation
Deciding to cancel a passed evaluation requires careful consideration. Once an evaluation is passed, canceling it means you cannot proceed with the PA (Professional Account) activation process. If you choose to cancel, refer to the Resetting Your Evaluation Account to understand the implications and steps involved.

Reviewing Trading Days and Profit & Loss (PnL)
To monitor your trading performance, it’s crucial to review your trading days and profit and loss (PnL) for PA accounts regularly. Access your PA charts through your account dashboard to ensure accurate tracking and analysis of your trading activities.

No More Evaluations Allowed
Receiving a notice that no more evaluations are allowed typically indicates that your account is under review by the relevant department. This status requires your attention to address any compliance issues or to provide the necessary documentation to continue trading.

Understanding Probation Status
If your account is placed on probation, it signifies that specific compliance guidelines need your attention. To navigate this status, review the details of your probation in your member dashboard: Trader Probation

Understanding the compliance rules and the required next steps is essential to restore your account to good standing.

Resetting a Canceled Account
In cases where your account has been canceled but remains within the subscription period, it remains tradable until the expiration date. To reset the account balance and parameters, you can perform a manual reset. Detailed instructions are available in the Resetting Your Evaluation Account article.

Manual Renewal of Subscription After Failed Rebill
A failed payment attempt can disrupt your subscription. To manually renew your subscription after a failed rebill, log into your dashboard, locate your invoice under Payment History, and select the “Renew Manually” option. This ensures your subscription remains active without interruption.

Avoid Trading Expired Contracts
Trading on expired contracts can result in breaches of account rules. To prevent this, utilize tools like the Batch Rollover feature in NinjaTrader, which helps keep your contracts updated automatically. For more information on rolling over contracts, refer to the How to Roll Over Futures Contracts guide.

Managing a Failed Rebill
When a rebill fails, your evaluation account subscription is automatically canceled. To reactivate your account, you must either create a new evaluation or update your payment method for future subscriptions. Ensuring your payment information is current can prevent such disruptions.

Dealing with Admin-Only Status
Accounts marked as “Admin-Only” indicate a failure to meet evaluation criteria. These accounts can be reset manually or automatically upon subscription renewal. To reset the account balance and trading parameters, follow the How to Reset an Account guide.

Updating Payment Methods
Preventing failed rebills starts with keeping your payment details up to date. Update your payment information through the dashboard under the “Update CC” section. Regularly verifying your billing information ensures smooth processing of your subscriptions.

Avoiding Subscription Overcharges
Accounts in a failed state remain active until they are canceled manually. To avoid overcharges, ensure that any unused accounts are canceled before the renewal date. For detailed instructions on canceling an account, refer to the Account Cancellation.

Handling Declined Payments
Declined payments can occur due to mismatched billing information or bank restrictions. To resolve this, ensure that your billing address matches your card details precisely. Verifying your payment information can help prevent declined transactions and maintain uninterrupted access to your trading account.

Effective management of your trading account involves staying proactive about evaluations, subscriptions, and compliance requirements. By understanding and utilizing the available resources and guides, you can maintain a smooth and profitable trading experience.

Once you have verified your information is correct, please follow the video below to settle the payment within 72 hours before the account expires and is no longer salvageable.
